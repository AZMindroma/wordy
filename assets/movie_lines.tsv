m86	ABE'S VOICE	hound of resurrection --
m86	ABE'S VOICE	Red -- you need to hear the rest of the information --
m86	HELLBOY	That's all for you Sammy.
m86	WHITMAN	From where??!!
m86	BROOM	Cordon off the area. Something came through.
m86	WHITMAN	Air and sea backup. What's closest?
m86	BROOM	If he's here this is worse than I thought.
m86	BROOM	Karl Ruprecht Kroenen one of the Reich's top Scientists. Head of the Thule Occult Society.
m86	WHITMAN	The freak in the gas mask --
m86	WHITMAN	Oh I'll bet you have.
m86	BROOM	I have seen ghosts Whitman.
m86	WHITMAN	Half transmission. Nonsense -- German ghost stories!
m86	BROOM	"Paranormal""""  But -- you read the transmission."
m86	WHITMAN	What a load of crap. Hell a week ago I hadn't even heard the word parabnormal --
m86	BROOM	Ruins. Not rocks. The remains of Trondham Abbey. Built on an intersection of Ley Lines the boundaries between our world and the other --
m86	WHITMAN	You're wasting our time: There's nothing on this island but sheep and rocks.
m86	WHITMAN	"Three days too late for that one """"professor."""""
m86	BROOM	I abhor violence.  Sergeant Whitman I hope you don't think me mad --
m86	WHITMAN	Here. You'll need one of these.
m86	BROOM	Amongst other things yes -- but that's hardly the point.
m86	WHITMAN	You are a Catholic??
m86	BROOM	In private if you don't mind...
m86	WHITMAN	What is it?
m86	BROOM	Sgt. Whitman!! Sgt. Whitman!! May I have a word??
m86	WHITMAN	Oh -- you don't wanna know what I think. Topside now.
m86	BROOM	This is an important mission Sgt. Whitman. I hope you realize that.
m86	BROOM	I think that is its hand.
m86	MATLIN	It's got a big stone -- in its hand --
m86	BROOM	No. It was red. Bright red.
m86	MATLIN	What the hell was that? An ape?
m86	MATLIN	That makes him more than a hundred --
m86	BROOM	Spiritual advisor to the Romanovs.  In 1916 at a dinner in his honor he was poisoned shot stabbed clubbed drowned and castrated.
m86	MATLIN	C'mon -- Rasputin??
m86	BROOM	Grigory Yefimovich Rasputin --
m86	MATLIN	Grigory -- That's Russian right?  Thought they were on our side...
m86	BROOM	There is a place -- a dark place where evil slumbers and awaits to return. From there it infects our dreams. Our thoughts. Grigory gave us a glance tonight --
m86	MATLIN	Do you believe in hell?
m86	BROOM	No. It's not.
m86	MATLIN	It's almost over!!
m86	BROOM	I know where to find him. I'll get him back.
m86	MANNING	These freaks Trevor they give me the creeps. And I'm not the only one. You're up for review. You and your petting zoo.
m86	BROOM	He's just going through a phase --
m86	MANNING	"Your """"guest"""" happens to be six foot five bright red and is government funded."
m86	BROOM	Tom -- he's our guest not a prisoner.
m86	MANNING	I do.  How many escapes?  This year alone: five!
m86	BROOM	I thought you liked being on TV.
m86	MANNING	Every time the media get a look at him they come to me. I'm running out of lies Trevor.
m86	HELLBOY	Oh as opposed to -- ?
m86	BROOM	It's her choice --  She's human --
m86	BROOM	That's not how she feels. She may never feel it.
m86	HELLBOY	How many buildings does she have to burn? She belongs here!
m86	HELLBOY	Is it bad?
m86	BROOM	Don't look! Turn around.
m86	HELLBOY	Oh stop that --  Damn! Be careful there --
m86	BROOM	Well I won't be around forever you know?
m86	HELLBOY	Me?? C'mon --
m86	BROOM	I worry about you.
m86	HELLBOY	How hard can it be? I punched the crap out of that thing that he sent -- ouch!!
m86	BROOM	Listen to me. This time is different. There's more at stake than ever before.
m86	HELLBOY	Don't worry. I'll get him soon enough --
m86	BROOM	Son. About Rasputin --
m86	BROOM	A prison. The Vatican deemed its contents dangerous enough to include it on the List of Avignon. Of which we hold a copy.
m86	HELLBOY	Reliquary --
m86	BROOM	Smuggled into this country by an overzealous curator. The statue however was hollow --
m86	HELLBOY	Who wards off demons.
m86	BROOM	A 16th century statue was destroyed. Saint Dionysius the Aeropagite.
m86	MYERS	"Oh please. I'm not """"pure of heart."""""
m86	BROOM	And as a father I worry about him.  In medieval stories Agent Myers there's often a young knight inexperienced but pure of heart...
m86	BROOM	You're doing fine.
m86	MYERS	I'm in way over my head I know that much.
m86	BROOM	Did he now?
m86	MYERS	1945 you mean. Hitler died in '45.
m86	BROOM	1958 the occult war finally ends when Adolf Hitler dies.
m86	BROOM	"In the absence of light darkness prevails."""" For there are things that go bump in the night Agent Myers.  We are the ones who bump back."
m86	MYERS	"In absentia luci tenebrae vinciunt..."""""
m86	BROOM	Impressive. Do you remember what it said?
m86	MYERS	On the desk yes. In Latin.
m86	BROOM	As you entered the lobby there was an inscription --
m86	MYERS	Where am I -- exactly Sir?
m86	BROOM	"Abe possesses a unique frontal lobe.  """"Unique."""" That's a word you'll hear quite a bit around here."
m86	MYERS	How does he know so much about me?
m86	BROOM	"The day Abraham Lincoln died. Hence """"Abe"""" Sapien."
m86	MYERS	Icthyo Sapiens April 14 1865.
m86	BROOM	They took his name from this little inscription that was stuck on his tank.
m86	HELLBOY	This -- ? This is nothing. You know what'll kill me?  Her.
m86	CLAY	C'mon champ. You look a little woozy there.
m86	HELLBOY	Hold on -- hold on -- I thought we checked this place. Fakes and reproductions.
m86	CLAY	At nineteen hundred hours an alarm tripped. B&E. Robbery. Six guards dead --
m86	HELLBOY	C'mon Champ! Happy Halloween!!! You're taking me for a walk!
m86	CLAY	We're on the move.
m86	HELLBOY	Hey hey hey. They're playing our song.
m86	CLAY	Try not to stare. He hates when people stare.
m86	HELLBOY	"Myers"""" huh? You have a first name??"
m86	CLAY	It is. You got yourself on TV again.
m86	HELLBOY	I wanted to see her.  It's nobody's business.
m86	CLAY	Well you did break out --
m86	CLAY	Manning says I'm too soft on you --  The candy. Give him the candy.
m86	HELLBOY	I don't want him.
m86	CLAY	Nah. I'll be around Red just back in the field.
m86	HELLBOY	Got tired of me?
m86	CLAY	Agent Myers is your new liaison.
m86	HELLBOY	Who's the squirt?
m86	CLAY	Not so fast. He barely knows him --
m86	MYERS	Sir may I go first??
m86	MYERS	His what??!!
m86	CLAY	"His horns. He files 'em. To """"fit in."""""
m86	MYERS	Uh-oh -- John.  Staring at what?
m86	CLAY	Yup. Sixty years old by our count. But he doesn't age like we do -- think dog years: He's barely out of his teens.
m86	MYERS	Oh Jesus!! Hellboy -- ?? Is real --
m86	MYERS	Who?!
m86	CLAY	He gets fed six times a day. He's got a thing for cats. You'll be his nanny his keeper his best friend. He never goes out unsupervised --
m86	CLAY	Okay. You saw the fish man right?
m86	MYERS	Grounded? Who's grounded?
m86	CLAY	They're not speaking. Professor Broom had him grounded.
m86	HELLBOY	I can live with that.
m86	GRIGORY	You will never fulfill your destiny. You will never understand the power inside you.
m86	HELLBOY	Anung-un-Rama...
m86	GRIGORY	"Names hold the power and nature of things. Mine for example. Rasputin: """"The crossroads.""""  And crossroads I have become.  Your true name: Anung-un-Rama. Repeat it. Become the key."
m86	HELLBOY	Noooo! Noooo!!!
m86	GRIGORY	She's dead.
m86	HELLBOY	Don't tell me it's Zeppo.
m86	GRIGORY	I sang the first lullaby you ever heard my child. I ushered you into this world.  I alone know your true calling your true name.
m86	HELLBOY	That voice --
m86	HELLBOY	My job.
m86	MANNING	Thank you.
m86	MANNING	You never ever light a cigar that way.
m86	HELLBOY	Yup.
m86	MANNING	You call that thing a cigar??
m86	HELLBOY	You'd better stay here. I'll find a way out. We'll come back for you.
m86	MANNING	I'm in charge. We go back!
m86	HELLBOY	No. Don't --
m86	MANNING	-- should go back. Now!
m86	HELLBOY	Don't move. We --
m86	MANNING	We should go back -- you -- you could tear that door apart --
m86	HELLBOY	I won't take 'em. They never work.
m86	MANNING	Each of us gets a belt.
m86	HELLBOY	Those things never work. Never.
m86	MANNING	We've installed a very handy timer. Set it walk away. Cable pulls the safety pins K-boom! Easy to clean easy to use...
m86	MANNING	When we do: No mumbo-jumbo. Double- core Vulcan-65 grenades.
m86	HELLBOY	"One falls two shall arise."""" So: you pop one two come out. You kill two you get four. You kill four you're in trouble. We have to nail 'em all at once. And the eggs."
m86	HELLBOY	I wish I could be more gracious but --
m86	MANNING	In the end after you've killed and captured every freak out there -- there's still one left: you.
m86	HELLBOY	What are you trying to say?
m86	MANNING	That's what you do. That's why we need you. You have an insight.  You know monsters.
m86	HELLBOY	No it doesn't make it right but I stopped that creature didn't I?
m86	MANNING	Ah I see. That makes it all alright then.
m86	HELLBOY	I knew those men better than you did --
m86	MANNING	But not everyone was so lucky.  Two agents died today. Clay probably won't survive the night. You're reckless.
m86	HELLBOY	How big can it be?
m86	MYERS	Alone?
m86	HELLBOY	Keep her safe. No matter what. I'll deal with whatever's back there.
m86	HELLBOY	On a scale of one to ten: two. But --  -- she'll take care of you Myers. She's a tough one.
m86	MYERS	Are you sure about this?
m86	HELLBOY	Good night.
m86	MYERS	Well good n-
m86	HELLBOY	Not from you.
m86	MYERS	Anything else you --
m86	HELLBOY	Not hungry.
m86	MYERS	Hey your chili's getting cold --
m86	MYERS	Start in you got nachos coming.
m86	HELLBOY	"Nah sounds too """"needy."""""
m86	MYERS	"Need"""" is a good solid word."
m86	HELLBOY	"Myers you're a talker. What's a good word -- a solid word for """"need"""" --"
m86	HELLBOY	Shh! Just a second.
m86	MYERS	Where do you --
m86	MYERS	Hostage negotiations.
m86	HELLBOY	What was that??
m86	HELLBOY	"What landed you this job pushing """"pamcakes""""? Punctuality? What was your area of expertise?"
m86	MYERS	I think I can help -- Talk to her -- I can bring her back.
m86	HELLBOY	Hey. You: think twice --
m86	MYERS	Professor that girl you were talking about --
m86	HELLBOY	"Mmmh -- """"Pamcakes."""" We're going out --"
m86	HELLBOY	Well let's see -- there was that moment when I had a train on top of my head --
m86	MYERS	Down there. Did you ever loose track of him?
m86	HELLBOY	That's right Stud hold me down.
m86	MYERS	You want me to hold him down?
m86	HELLBOY	Could've fooled me. Go away.
m86	MYERS	No. I never was.
m86	HELLBOY	What are you a Boy Scout?
m86	MYERS	C'mon time to go home. Tape you up.
m86	HELLBOY	What took you so long?
m86	HELLBOY	Goodbye.
m86	MYERS	Yes?
m86	HELLBOY	Myers?
m86	MYERS	No. Stop. Don't do this -- Listen to me -- Tell me where you are --
m86	HELLBOY	No no no it's fine: I do my job I take a break.
m86	MYERS	Wait -- Wait -- You can't go anywhere -- I gotta go with you --
m86	HELLBOY	I just fried Stinky. Tell Father I'll be home. He shouldn't wait up.
m86	MYERS	My arm is fine. Where are you??
m86	HELLBOY	Myers??? How's your arm?
m86	HELLBOY	No one ever helps me. It's my job.
m86	MYERS	Helping you -- I just --
m86	MYERS	Oh-n-no -- I --
m86	HELLBOY	Whatcha looking at John??
m86	HELLBOY	Father's back?  Still angry?
m86	MYERS	Oh. Uh. Hello. I -- I have these. For you.
m86	HELLBOY	Those comics -- They never got the eyes right.
m86	MYERS	You're kidding --
m86	HELLBOY	...Polo.
m86	LIZ	Marco...
m86	HELLBOY	Okay someone's expecting us. Turn on your locators -- Anyone sees anything...
m86	HELLBOY	Good.
m86	LIZ	I like that...
m86	HELLBOY	Listen. I'm not like Myers. He makes you feel like you belong. And -- that's good. It really is. I -- wish I could do something about this --  But I can't.  I can promise you only two things... One: I'll always look this good. Two: I won't give up on you. Ever.
m86	LIZ	Red I --
m86	HELLBOY	But I understand what you don't like about me. I do. What I am makes you feel out of place -- out there --
m86	LIZ	I've changed my mind. I'll come to Moscow. If you -- are still going --
m86	HELLBOY	Hi.
m86	LIZ	Oh okay then. Maybe later then.
m86	HELLBOY	It's nothing. Just a list -- It's not finished --
m86	LIZ	No. Myers is taking me.
m86	HELLBOY	You're going alone?
m86	LIZ	For a cup of coffee but go ahead read.
m86	HELLBOY	Out? Out out?
m86	LIZ	Well. Is it long?? I'm going out but --
m86	HELLBOY	Um... Liz -- I -- there's something I'd like you to -- something I need you to hear.
m86	LIZ	Goodnight.
m86	HELLBOY	Goodnight then.
m86	LIZ	No. Not this time H.B. It's been months since I've had an episode. And you know what? I'm learning to control it.
m86	HELLBOY	We miss you at the Bureau. Abe's crazier every day. And Father's still mad at me --  Come back Liz. Come back. I --
m86	HELLBOY	Just a scratch.  I wanted to see you.
m86	LIZ	You better have that looked at.
m86	MYERS	What?
m86	LIZ	Hit me.
m86	LIZ	You want to know -- Now -- ? Here? Red white whatever -- Guys are all the same.
m86	MYERS	That you feel that way about me.
m86	LIZ	What -- ?
m86	MYERS	But it's not true is it?
m86	LIZ	Coffee's warming me up.
m86	MYERS	It's freezing isn't it?
m86	LIZ	Don't know. Really. I grew up with him.  I've missed him too but now every time I see him I get confused. Hardly a day goes by he's not in my mind. Even now I feel he's here --
m86	MYERS	What about you?
m86	LIZ	I know.
m86	MYERS	He -- loves you.
m86	MYERS	My uncle used to say... we like people for their qualities but love them for their defects.
m86	LIZ	A brute.
m86	MYERS	Strong.
m86	LIZ	Cocky.
m86	MYERS	No... He's determined. Unstoppable --
m86	LIZ	He's just pushy.
m86	MYERS	I admire him. He's a force of nature.
m86	MYERS	Miss Sherman he's asking you back but it's entirely your choice.
m86	LIZ	Doesn't sounds like him.
m86	MYERS	Dr. Broom asked me to invite you back to the Bureau. No special precautions no security escorts. You and me in a taxi. Like regular folks.
m86	MYERS	It's still impressive by my standards: My name's John.
m86	LIZ	"60% OF THE WOMEN IN THIS WORLD ARE NAMED """"LIZ""""."
m86	MYERS	Liz -- can I call you Liz? It's a beautiful name --
m86	LOBBY GUARD	Two steps back please.
m86	MYERS	Pardon?
m86	LOBBY GUARD	-- Section fifty-one. Step back.
m86	MYERS	Yes I --
m86	LOBBY GUARD	-- Late. Five minutes late.
m86	MYERS	Hello I'm --
m98	SALLAH	The dog!?  You are named after the dog...
m98	BRODY	May we go home now please?
m98	BRODY	Did you say...? Uh uh...
m98	SALLAH	Egyptian Mail. Morning edition.  Run!
m98	BRODY	Yes.
m98	SALLAH	Papers sir. Got it here.
m98	BRODY	Yes.
m98	SALLAH	There is no museum in Iskenderun.
m98	BRODY	My reputation precedes me.
m98	SALLAH	And I am his.
m98	BRODY	Oh what?... your servant sir.
m98	BRODY	Oh this map will show you. It was drawn by uh...
m98	SALLAH	Oh yes of course. But where are we going?
m98	BRODY	Yes but don't panic. Everything's under control. Have you... have you arranged our supplies?
m98	SALLAH	You are on your own?
m98	BRODY	Oh he's in Austria. A slight detour.
m98	SALLAH	Marcus Brody sir. And where is Indy?
m98	BRODY	Oh Sallah! What a relief!
m98	INDY	It's... a leap of faith. Oh God.
m98	BRODY	Indy... Indy you must hurry!! Come quickly!
m98	INDY	I'm going after Dad.
m98	BRODY	What about you?
m98	INDY	Marcus get hold of Sallah. Tell him to meet you in Iskenderun.
m98	BRODY	Yes. Now we know.
m98	INDY	Alexandretta. Now we know.
m98	BRODY	Now he knew there was a city with an oasis due east. Here. He knew the course turned south through the desert to a river and the river led into the mountains. Here. Straight to the canyon. He knew everything except where to begin the name of the city.
m98	BRODY	Your father would know. Your father did know. Look. He made a map.
m98	INDY	"The present city of Iskenderun is built on its ruins. Marcus -- you remember what the Grail Tablet said. """"Across the desert and through the mountain to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon.""""  But where exactly?"
m98	BRODY	"It's better now I've seen this. It's the name of a city. """"Alexandretta?"""" Hmmm..."
m98	INDY	How's the head?
m98	BRODY	Well now we know the source of the numbers but we still don't know what they mean.
m98	INDY	Dad was onto something here!
m98	BRODY	Look Indy. The Roman numerals!
m98	BRODY	Where?
m98	INDY	Marcus -- I've seen this window before.
m98	BRODY	It looks like a converted church.
m98	INDY	That doesn't look much like a library.
m98	INDY	I don't know. Maybe he'll know us.
m98	BRODY	Yes. Uh how will we recognize this Doctor Schneider when we see him?
m98	INDY	Ah Venice...
m98	BRODY	I'll tell him we'll take two.
m98	INDY	Call Donovan Marcus. Tell him I'll take that ticket to Venice now.
m98	BRODY	But if you want facts Indy I have none to give you. At my age I'm prepared to take a few things on faith.
m98	BRODY	The search for the Cup of Christ is the search for the divine in all of us.
m98	INDY	Do you believe the Grail actually exists?
m98	INDY	Do you believe Marcus?
m98	BRODY	I don't know. But someone must want it pretty badly.
m98	INDY	It's Dad's Grail Diary. Every clue he ever followed. Every discovery he made. A complete record of his search for the Holy Grail. This is his whole life. Why would he have sent this to me?
m98	BRODY	What is it?
m98	INDY	Venice Italy!
m98	BRODY	It's today's mail. And it's been opened.
m98	INDY	Dad?
m98	INDY	I don't know. But whatever it is he's in over his head!
m98	BRODY	What has the old fool got himself into now?
m98	BRODY	Yes. My treat.
m98	INDY	Your treat.
m98	BRODY	Well done Indy. Very well done indeed. This will find a place of honor in our Spanish collection.
m98	INDY	All my life!
m98	BRODY	All your life.
m98	INDY	You know how long I've been looking for that?!
m98	BRODY	You've got it!
m98	INDY	Marcus!  I did it!
m98	HENRY	Got lost in his own museum huh?
m98	BRODY	Indy! Henry! Follow met I know the way!  Haaa!
m98	HENRY	The Name of God...
m98	BRODY	No Henry. Try not to talk.
m98	HENRY	The Word of God...
m98	HENRY	It's war.
m98	BRODY	Look what you did!
m98	BRODY	But don't you see? The pen is mightier than the sword.
m98	HENRY	What?
m98	BRODY	Henry the pen --
m98	HENRY	It's a rescue old boy. Come on.
m98	BRODY	Henry! What are you doing here?!
m98	BRODY	Arghhh! Oh!
m98	HENRY	Marcus!
m98	BRODY	You're meddling with powers you cannot possibly comprehend.
m98	DONOVAN	Well Marcus we are on the brink of the recovery of the greatest artifact in the history of mankind.
m98	BRODY	I'd rather spit in your face. But as I haven't got any spit...
m98	DONOVAN	Care to wet your whistle Marcus?
m98	BRODY	Oh well. That's good. Thank you.
m98	DONOVAN	I maintain an apartment in Venice at your disposal.
m98	BRODY	Schneider?
m98	DONOVAN	Don't worry. Doctor Schneider will be there to meet you.
m98	BRODY	Tell me what's going to happen when we get to Venice?
m98	INDY	How dare he?!
m98	BUTLER	This is a castle. And we have many tapestries. But if you're a Scottish lord then I am Mickey Mouse.
m98	INDY	Dear me the man is dense. This is a castle isn't it? There are tapestries?
m98	BUTLER	Tapestries?
m98	INDY	Don't take that tone with me my good man. Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries.
m98	BUTLER	Are you expected?
m98	DONOVAN	We're through!
m98	INDY	I'm through!
m98	DONOVAN	You know something Doctor Jones? You're absolutely right.
m98	INDY	Shooting me won't get you anywhere.
m98	DONOVAN	Nazis?! -- Is that the limit of your vision?! The Nazis want to write themselves into the Grail legend and take on the world. Well they're welcome. But I want the Grail itself. The cup that gives everlasting life. Hitler can have the world but he can't take it with him. I'm going to be drinking my own health when he's gone the way of the Dodo.  The Grail is mine and you're going to get it for me.
m98	INDY	As what? A Nazi stooge like you?
m98	DONOVAN	Impossible? What do you say Jones? Ready to go down in history?
m98	DONOVAN	Didn't I warn you not to trust anybody Doctor Jones?
m98	INDY	DONOVAN!
m98	DONOVAN	We already have. Your father is the man who's disappeared.
m98	INDY	You've got the wrong Jones Mister Donovan. Why don't you try my father?
m98	DONOVAN	We've hit a snag. Our project leader has vanished. Along with all his research. Uh we received a cable from his colleague Doctor Schneider who has no idea of his whereabouts or what's become of him.  I want you to pick up the trail where he left off. Find the man and you will find the Grail.
m98	INDY	Yes?
m98	DONOVAN	You could be more right than you know.
m98	INDY	That's usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet.
m98	DONOVAN	"This is the manuscript in which the friar chronicled the Knight's story... it doesn't reveal on location of the Grail I'm afraid... but the Knight promised that two """"markers"""" that had been left behind would.  This Tablet is one of those """"markers."""" It proves the Knight's story is true. But as you pointed out -- it's incomplete.  Now the second """"marker"""" is entombed with the Knight's dead brother. Our project leader believes that tomb to be located within the city of Venice Italy.  As you can now see Doctor Jones we're about to complete a great quest that began almost two thousand years ago. We're only one step away."
m98	DONOVAN	"Not ""supposedly Doctor Jones."
m98	INDY	I've heard this one as well. Two of these brothers walked out of the desert one hundred and fifty years after having found the Grail and began the long journey back to France. But only one of them made it. And before dying of extreme old age, he supposedly imparted his tale to a -- to a Franciscan friar, I think.
m98	DONOVAN	Let me tell you another bedtime story Doctor Jones. After the Grail was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea, it disappeared and was lost for a thousand years before it was found again by three Knights of the First Crusade. Three brothers, to be exact.
m98	DONOVAN	Just the same, an attempt to recover the Grail is currently underway.
m98	INDY	What good is it? This Grail Tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons. Pretty vague. Where do you start looking? Maybe if the Tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on. But the entire top portion is missing.
m98	DONOVAN	Hard to resist, isn't it? The Holy Grail's final resting place described in detail!
m98	DONOVAN	Every man's dream.  Including your father's, I believe.
m98	INDY	An old man's dream.
m98	DONOVAN	Eternal life, Doctor Jones! The gift of youth to whoever drinks from the Grail.  Oh, now that's a bedtime story I'd like to wake up to!
m98	INDY	The Arthur Legend. I've heard this bedtime story before.
m98	DONOVAN	The Holy Grail, Doctor Jones. The chalice used by Christ during the Last Supper. The cup that caught His blood at the Crucifixion and was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea.
m98	INDY	"Where the cup that holds the blood of Jesus Christ resides forever."""
m98	DONOVAN	My engineers unearthed it in the mountain region north of Ankara while excavating for copper.  Can you translate the inscription?
m98	INDY	Where did this come from?
m98	DONOVAN	That was our assessment as well.
m98	INDY	Well it's sandstone. Christian symbol. Early Latin text. Mid-Twelfth Century I should think.
m98	DONOVAN	Well like yourself Doctor Jones I have a passion for antiquities.  Have a look over here. This might interest you.
m98	INDY	I know who you are Mr. Donovan. Your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous. Some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive.
m98	DONOVAN	My name is Donovan. Walter Donovan.
m98	ELSA	I can reach it. I can reach it...
m98	INDY	Elsa. Elsa don't. Elsa. Elsa. Give me your other hand honey. I can't hold you.
m98	INDY	Elsa don't cross the Seal. The Knight warned us not to take the Grail from here.
m98	ELSA	It's ours Indy. Yours and mine.
m98	INDY	Elsa! Elsa don't move!
m98	INDY	I'm like a bad penny. I always turn up.
m98	ELSA	I never expected to see you again.
m98	ELSA	All I have to do is scream.
m98	INDY	All I have to do is squeeze.
m98	ELSA	You do.
m98	INDY	Yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the Grail stands for -- who gives a damn what you think?
m98	ELSA	Is that what you think of me? I believe in the Grail not the Swastika.
m98	INDY	My father didn't want it incinerated.
m98	ELSA	You came back for the book? Why?
m98	INDY	Where is it? I want it.
m98	ELSA	How did you get here?
m98	INDY	So it did.
m98	ELSA	This book contained a map -- a map with no names -- precise directions from the unknown city to the secret Canyon of the Crescent Moon.
m98	ELSA	How do you know?
m98	INDY	This one. I think he's in here.
m98	INDY	Don't know. Think of something.
m98	ELSA	What are you going to do?
m98	ELSA	I know the Brunwalds are famous art collectors.
m98	INDY	What do you know about this place?
m98	ELSA	It's lucky I don't do things the same way. You'd still be standing at the Venice pier.
m98	INDY	No. You like the way I do things.
m98	ELSA	No?
m98	INDY	Knock it off. You're not mad.
m98	ELSA	Oh yes. Give them a flower and they'll follow you anywhere.
m98	INDY	At least I let you tag along.
m98	ELSA	You had it? You didn't trust me!
m98	INDY	Uh-huh.
m98	ELSA	The Grail Diary.
m98	INDY	This.
m98	ELSA	What were they looking for?
m98	INDY	Mine too.
m98	ELSA	My room!
m98	INDY	I said don't go between them!
m98	ELSA	You said go between them!
m98	INDY	I said go around!
m98	ELSA	What?
m98	INDY	Don't wander off.
m98	INDY	He never would have made it past the rats! He hates rats! He's scared to death of them!
m98	ELSA	Wouldn't it be wonderful if he were here now to see this?
m98	INDY	It's a rubbing Dad made of the Grail Tablet.
m98	ELSA	What's that?
m98	ELSA	Look at the artistry of these carvings and the scrollwork.
m98	INDY	It must be one of these...
m98	INDY	Pretty sure.
m98	ELSA	Are you sure?
m98	INDY	The Ark of the Covenant.
m98	ELSA	The Christians would have dug their own passages and burial chambers centuries later.
m98	INDY	Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades.
m98	ELSA	Pagan symbols. Fourth or Fifth Century.
m98	ELSA	Lower me down.
m98	INDY	Except he's lost and I'm not.
m98	ELSA	You don't disappoint Doctor Jones. You're a great deal like your father.
m98	INDY	Bingo.
m98	ELSA	Find something?
m98	INDY	My dad sent me this Diary for a reason. Until we find out why I suggest we keep it to ourselves.
m98	INDY	Tomorrow I'll steal you another.
m98	ELSA	But I'm already sad -- by tomorrow it will have faded.
m98	INDY	It would make me very happy.
m98	ELSA	In that case I permit you.
m98	INDY	I usually don't either.
m98	ELSA	I usually don't.
m98	INDY	Fraulein -- will you permit me?
m98	INDY	Who? Attila the Professor? He was never giddy even when he was a schoolboy!
m98	ELSA	The last time I saw your father we were in the library. He was very close to tracking down the Knight's Tomb. I've never seen him so excited. He was as giddy as a schoolboy.
m98	ELSA	Looks like the best parts have already been spoken for.
m98	INDY	And my mother's ears. But the rest belongs to you.
m98	ELSA	I knew it was you --
m98	INDY	Yes?
m98	ELSA	Doctor Jones?
m98	INDY	Yes sir!  Haaa!
m98	HENRY	After you Junior.
m98	INDY	Uh-huh.
m98	HENRY	Ready.
m98	INDY	Ready?
m98	HENRY	We named the dog Indiana.
m98	INDY	I like Indiana.
m98	INDY	Junior?! Dad...
m98	HENRY	What did you find Junior?
m98	HENRY	Me?... Illumination.
m98	INDY	What did you find Dad?
m98	HENRY	Elsa never really believed in the Grail. She thought she'd found a prize.
m98	INDY	I can get it -- I can almost reach it Dad.
m98	HENRY	Junior give me your other hand! I can't hold on!!
m98	INDY	"J""""."
m98	HENRY	"But in the Latin alphabet """"Jehovah"""" begins with an """"I""""."
m98	INDY	The penitent man is humble...
m98	HENRY	Penitent. Penitent...
m98	INDY	The penitent man is humble before God.
m98	HENRY	The penitent man. The penitent...
m98	INDY	The penitent man will pass. The penitent... the penitent. The penitent man...
m98	HENRY	"Only the penitent man will pass. Only the penitent man will pass."""""
m98	HENRY	Junior...
m98	INDY	Dad?!
m98	INDY	Get out of there Dad!
m98	HENRY	You call this archaeology?
m98	INDY	Dad?
m98	INDY	Who cares? As long as they're keeping Donovan busy. Dad you stay here while Sallah and I organize some transportation.
m98	HENRY	Now who are all these people?
m98	INDY	Dad we're well out of range.
m98	HENRY	What do you think you're doing?! Get down!
m98	INDY	This could be close.
m98	HENRY	This is intolerable!
m98	INDY	It happens to me all the time.
m98	HENRY	It's a new experience for me.
m98	INDY	I know Dad!
m98	HENRY	Those people are trying to kill us!
m98	INDY	Thanks.
m98	HENRY	Nice landing.
m98	HENRY	More or less.  Son I'm sorry. They got us.
m98	INDY	Dad are we hit?!
m98	HENRY	What happens at eleven o'clock?
m98	INDY	Dad -- eleven o'clock!!
m98	INDY	Fly... yes. Land... no.
m98	HENRY	I didn't know you could fly a plane.
m98	HENRY	I don't know. We'll find out.
m98	INDY	What does that mean?
m98	HENRY	"Then what are you complaining about?  Look we have work to do. When we get to Alexandretta we will face three challenges.  """"First the breath of God. Only the penitent man will pass. Second the Word of God only in the footsteps of God will he proceed. Third the Path of God only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth."""""
m98	INDY	Well... I can't think of anything.
m98	HENRY	Very well. I'm here now.
m98	INDY	Dad how can you?
m98	HENRY	You left just when you were becoming interesting.
m98	INDY	What you taught me was that I was less important to you than people who had been dead for five hundred years in another country. And I learned it so well that we've hardly spoken for twenty years.
m98	HENRY	Did I ever tell you to eat up? Go to bed? Wash your ears? Do your homework? No. I respected your privacy and I taught you self-reliance.
m98	INDY	When?
m98	HENRY	Actually I was a wonderful father.
m98	INDY	A regret. It was just the two of us Dad. It was a lonely way to grow up. For you too. If you had been an ordinary average father like the other guys' dads you'd have understood that.
m98	HENRY	And do I detect a rebuke?
m98	INDY	We didn't talk. We never talked.
m98	HENRY	Hmmm... What did we talk about?
m98	INDY	Do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink? I had a milk shake.
m98	HENRY	Ships that pass in the night...
m98	INDY	I was the next man.
m98	HENRY	Well I'm as human as the next man.
m98	INDY	That's not all we shared. It's disgraceful. You're old enough to be her fa... er her grandfather!
m98	HENRY	You know sharing your adventures is an interesting experience.
m98	INDY	Relax.
m98	HENRY	When we're airborne with Germany behind us then I'll share that sentiment.
m98	HENRY	Good.
m98	INDY	I don't know. The first available flight out of Germany.
m98	HENRY	What did you get?
m98	HENRY	Oh yes she did. Only too well. Unfortunately she kept her illness from me until all I could do was mourn her.
m98	INDY	This is an obsession Dad. I never understood it. Never. Neither did Mom.
m98	HENRY	That's for blasphemy. The quest for the Grail is not archaeology. It's a race against evil. If it is captured by the Nazis the armies of darkness will march all over the face of the earth. Do you understand me?
m98	INDY	Two selfless martyrs. Jesus Christ!
m98	HENRY	Marcus would agree with me.
m98	INDY	What about Marcus?
m98	HENRY	Yes! The only thing that matters is the Grail.
m98	INDY	Half the German Army's on our tail and you want me to go to Berlin? Into the lion's den?
m98	HENRY	I wrote them down in my Diary so that I wouldn't have to remember.
m98	INDY	But what are they? Can't you remember?
m98	HENRY	Oh yes. But I found the clues that will safely take us through in the Chronicles of St. Anselm.
m98	INDY	Booby traps?
m98	HENRY	Three devices of such lethal cunning.
m98	INDY	What final challenge?
m98	HENRY	Well he who finds the Grail must face the final challenge.
m98	INDY	All right Dad -- tell me.
m98	HENRY	There is more in the Diary than just the map.
m98	INDY	You don't need the Diary Dad. Marcus has the map.
m98	HENRY	My Diary's in Berlin.
m98	INDY	Brody's this way.
m98	HENRY	You're going the wrong Way! We have to get to Berlin!
m98	HENRY	Stop! Stop!
m98	INDY	What?
m98	HENRY	Stop!
m98	HENRY	What about the boat? We're not going on the boat?
m98	INDY	Come on Dad. Come on!
m98	HENRY	...the solution presents itself.
m98	INDY	Dad!
m98	INDY	I'm out Dad!
m98	HENRY	This is intolerable!
m98	HENRY	Oh.
m98	INDY	Head for the fireplace!
m98	HENRY	What?
m98	INDY	Dad!
m98	HENRY	What?
m98	INDY	Dad!
m98	HENRY	What?
m98	INDY	Dad!
m98	INDY	All right move! Move! Rock your Chair. Do what I do.
m98	HENRY	And the chair.
m98	INDY	What???
m98	HENRY	The floor's on fire! See?!
m98	INDY	Don't get sentimental now Dad -- save it 'til we get out of here.
m98	HENRY	I ought to tell you something.
m98	INDY	Try and burn through the ropes.
m98	HENRY	Feels like a cigarette lighter.
m98	INDY	My lucky charm.
m98	HENRY	What am I looking for?
m98	INDY	Are you kidding? -- I made that up! You know Marcus -- he got lost once in his own museum!
m98	HENRY	You said he had two days' start. That he would blend in. Disappear!
m98	INDY	Let's try and get these ropes loose. We've got to get to Marcus before the Nazis do!
m98	HENRY	So did I.
m98	INDY	Ooooh... I like the Austrian way better.
m98	HENRY	She talks in her sleep.
m98	INDY	How did you she was a Nazi?
m98	HENRY	Umh?
m98	INDY	She ransacked her own room and I fell for it. How did you know she was a Nazi?
m98	HENRY	Don't worry. He won't.
m98	INDY	No! Don't Shoot!
m98	HENRY	Oh yeah? And who's gonna come to save you Junior??
m98	INDY	I came here to save you.
m98	HENRY	Take it easy?! Why do you think I sent it home in the first place?  So it wouldn't fall into their hands!!
m98	INDY	Will you take it easy!
m98	HENRY	I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers.
m98	INDY	Look can we discuss this later?
m98	HENRY	You did!!
m98	INDY	Well uh...
m98	HENRY	You didn't did you?  You didn't bring it did you?
m98	INDY	Yeah?
m98	HENRY	They want my diary.
m98	INDY	Yeah big ones. What do the Nazis want with you Dad?
m98	HENRY	Rats?
m98	INDY	There were rats Dad.
m98	HENRY	If only I could have been with you.
m98	INDY	No Dad. You did. Forty years.
m98	HENRY	...you did it.
m98	HENRY	Alexandretta... of course... on the pilgrim trail from the Eastern Empire. Oh Junior...
m98	INDY	Alexandretta.  It's a great moment in Henry's life. He turns aside lost to himself for a moment then turns to Indy with joy.
m98	HENRY	And his shield... the inscription on Sir Richard's shield...?
m98	INDY	Well what was left of him.
m98	HENRY	He was actually there? You saw him?
m98	INDY	Found it.
m98	HENRY	I knew it. And the tomb of Sir Richard?
m98	INDY	Right.
m98	HENRY	Through the library?
m98	INDY	I got it and I used it. We found the entrance to the catacombs.
m98	HENRY	Humpf -- so I was wrong this time. But by God I wasn't wrong when I mailed you my Diary. You obviously got it.
m98	HENRY	Good point.
m98	INDY	Dad they come in through the doors.
m98	HENRY	Well I am sorry about your head though. But I thought you were one of them.
m98	INDY	No! Dad get your stuff. We've got to get out of here.
m98	HENRY	Thank God!
m98	INDY	Don't worry -- I'm fine.
m98	HENRY	I'll never forgive myself --
m98	INDY	And the head.  You hit me Dad!
m98	HENRY	Oh it breaks the heart.
m98	INDY	I came to get you! What do you think?
m98	HENRY	But what are you doing here?
m98	INDY	Don't call me that please.
m98	HENRY	It is you Junior!
m98	HENRY	Junior!
m98	INDY	No Dad. You listen to me --
m98	HENRY	Then wait -- count to twenty.
m98	INDY	It's important!
m98	HENRY	Out!
m98	INDY	Dad!
m98	KNIGHT	I was chosen because I was the bravest and the most worthy. The honor was mine until another came to challenge me to single combat. I pass it to you who vanquished me.
m98	INDY	I'm not exactly... a knight. What do you mean?
m98	KNIGHT	You're strangely dressed... for a knight.
m98	KNIGHT	A long time to wait.
m98	INDY	That was seven hundred years ago.
m98	KNIGHT	The last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the Grail and to guard it.
m98	INDY	Who are you?
m98	KNIGHT	I knew you'd come but my strength has left me.
m98	SALLAH	They have them. In the belly of that steel beast.
m98	INDY	Where's my father?
m98	SALLAH	Compensation for my brother-in-law's car. Indy your father and Brody --
m98	INDY	Sallah I said no camels! That's five camels. Can't you Count?
m98	INDY	No camels!
m98	SALLAH	But Indy --
m98	INDY	I don't need camels.
m98	SALLAH	I'll take the camels.
m98	INDY	I'm going after those horses.
m98	INDY	Come on -- come on!
m98	SALLAH	That car belonged to my brother-in- law.
m98	SALLAH	Ah they set out across the desert this afternoon. I believe they took Mister Brody with them.
m98	INDY	What happened to Marcus Sallah?
m98	SALLAH	Get that camel out of the way!
m98	KAZIM	In that case God be with you in your quest. Your father is being held in the Castle of Brunwald on the Austrian-German border.
m98	INDY	I didn't come for the Cup of Christ. I came to find my father.
m98	KAZIM	Ask yourself why do you seek the Cup of Christ? Is it for His glory or for yours?
m98	KAZIM	The secret of the Grail has been safe for a thousand years. And for all that time the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword has been prepared to do anything to keep it safe.
m98	INDY	And why were you trying to kill me?
m98	KAZIM	My name is Kazim.
m98	INDY	Who are you?
m98	KAZIM	If you let me go I will tell you where he is.
m98	INDY	All right! Where's my father
m98	KAZIM	No Doctor Jones. It's yours!
m98	INDY	This is your last chance.
m98	KAZIM	My soul is prepared. How's yours?
m98	INDY	Then we'll die.
m98	KAZIM	If you don't let go Doctor Jones we'll both die.
m98	INDY	Where is he? Talk -- or you're dead. Damn it tell me! Tell me!
m98	KAZIM	No.
m98	INDY	My father was looking for the Holy Grail. Did you kill him too?
m98	KAZIM	Because you're looking for the Holy Grail.
m98	INDY	Why are you trying to kill us?
m159	JACK	Mr. Gibbs organize a cleaning detail -- you and Cotton.  I want every inch of the Pearl spic-and- span and ship-shape!
m159	ANAMARIA	Aye aye sir!
m159	JACK	AnaMaria trim the mainsail!
m159	JACK	They'll be anchored on the lee side.  Haul your wind and keep to the weather of the island --
m159	ANAMARIA	How does he do that?
m159	ANAMARIA	I will.
m159	JACK	You'll get it back.  Or one better.
m159	ANAMARIA	That boat is my livelihood!
m159	JACK	Safe!  At Port Royal.  With the Royal Navy.
m159	ANAMARIA	My dory.  The Jolly Mon.  Where is it?
m159	JACK	AnaMaria!  Have you seen Gibbs?  I need to put together --
m159	ANAMARIA	You stole my boat.
m159	WILL	He didn't waste it.
m159	BARBOSSA	Hah.  Ten years you carried that pistol and you end up wasting your shot.
m159	BARBOSSA	Quite boy or you'll lose your tongue.  Those as know me know I wouldn't cross my word and bring down bad luck on the ship.  I agreed to set them free.  I didn't when ... nor where.
m159	WILL	No!  You gave your word!
m159	BARBOSSA	Eh?  You have my word then -- on the Good Book I do swear and the Lord spare my worthless soul.
m159	WILL	You must swear by the Holy Bible.
m159	WILL	And Jack.  And the crew.  Free and unharmed.  If you agree ... then ... I will remain with you.
m159	BARBOSSA	We got that part.  Anything else?
m159	WILL	Elizabeth goes free!
m159	BARBOSSA	Enough of that!  Name your terms.
m159	WILL	You can't.  I can.
m159	BARBOSSA	You've got one shot -- and we can't die.
m159	WILL	She.  Goes.  Free.
m159	BARBOSSA	What's in your head boy?
m159	JACK	Or you could surrender.
m159	BARBOSSA	So what now Jack Sparrow?  Are we to be two immortals locked in epic battle until the trumpets of Judgement Day?
m159	JACK	Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
m159	BARBOSSA	Just so you know Jack -- I don't think you're that clever.  I think you're a fool.  A mortal fool.
m159	BARBOSSA	Aye for us there is.
m159	JACK	There's ... another exit?
m159	BARBOSSA	Men!  Are you up for it?
m159	JACK	Now you can take care of the Dauntless right?
m159	JACK	Aye.  See after you're done with the Royal Navy you'll have a bit of a problem: the H.M.S. Dauntless. There you'll be with two lovely ships on your hands and what to do?  Of course you'll decide you deserve the bigger one and who's to argue?  The Dauntless a first- rate ship-of-line and with it you can rule the seas.  But if you're Captain of the Dauntless who's left for the Black Pearl?
m159	BARBOSSA	That so?
m159	JACK	The situation has changed.
m159	BARBOSSA	I can't help wondering Jack why you're being so helpful and all? Last time you did that it didn't end well for you.
m159	JACK	Like after you've killed ... Every ... Last ... One ... of Norrington's men.
m159	BARBOSSA	What're you suggesting?
m159	JACK	You've no hope of surviving Norrington's attack ... that is if you're mortal.
m159	JACK	Because right about now the H.M.S. Dauntless is lying in wait in the harbor.
m159	BARBOSSA	Why don't I want to do this?
m159	JACK	All right then.
m159	BARBOSSA	No I really think I do.
m159	BARBOSSA	That's fair.
m159	JACK	You can go to your grave not knowing.
m159	BARBOSSA	So how did you get off that island anyway?
m159	JACK	The last time you do this you left me a pistol with one shot.
m159	BARBOSSA	You'd best take a swim Jack.
m159	JACK	Someone needs to cut these bonds then.
m159	BARBOSSA	Now Jack.  That reef is less than a league distant.  It's a square deal all around and you can't hope for better.
m159	JACK	It's pure evil to make a Captain walk the plank of his own ship twice in one lifetime.  No good can come of it.
m159	BARBOSSA	Bosun!  Set up Mr. Sparrow's quarters nice and fine ... in the brig.  Meaning no disrespect of course.
m159	JACK	I'll watch my back.
m159	BARBOSSA	That fool woman took it.  You be careful around her Jack -- she's pretty enough she'll steal your heart -- but pure evil inside.
m159	JACK	What -- you don't have the medallion?
m159	BARBOSSA	You're playing this as close to the edge as any man I'll give you that.  We might just have to sign articles you and I.  Jack you're a pirate at heart that's certain.
m159	JACK	See that's where we're different. I trust you ... to do what it takes to get what you want.
m159	BARBOSSA	Jack I don't trust you and that's a fact.  Never trust a smiling man you can lay to that.
m159	BARBOSSA	Track you down and --
m159	JACK	Let's say I tell you the wrong person.  What would you do?
m159	BARBOSSA	You're setting me up for a double cross you with the ship and me with nothing more than your word!
m159	JACK	Wait as long as you like.
m159	BARBOSSA	Blast you!  I'll throw you in prison.
m159	JACK	You left me on a desert island -- what worse can you do?
m159	BARBOSSA	I'll torture it out of you.
m159	JACK	You see I've got this honest streak in me -- in its own way a sort of curse.  Oh and there's the fact that you have no choice.
m159	BARBOSSA	I'm supposed to ... trust you?
m159	JACK	That's right.
m159	BARBOSSA	That's your offer?  You sailing away nice and pretty with the Black Pearl and all I have is a name?
m159	JACK	You give me the Pearl.  Then I tell you who you need.
m159	BARBOSSA	The Pearl?  Oh that's fine.  And just how do you expect this to work?
m159	JACK	Simple.  I have something you won't more than anything.  The way to free you from the curse of the treasure.  You have something I want -- more than anything.
m159	BARBOSSA	Allow me the humor of listening to your terms.
m159	JACK	No you won't.
m159	BARBOSSA	Say the name or I slit your throat.
m159	JACK	I know whose blood you need to end the curse.
m159	BARBOSSA	No.  But him I believe.  He us genuinely angry.
m159	PINTEL	Do you believe him?
m159	PINTEL	I guess there is a reason to fret.
m159	BARBOSSA	Turner blood doesn't flow pure in his veins.  Best play it safe and spill it all.
m159	PINTEL	No reason to fret.  It's just a prick of the finger and a few drops of blood.
m159	BARBOSSA	By the powers you're right!  Where's Jack's pistol?  Who's got it?  Bring it forward!
m159	PINTEL	That's proper sir according to the code.
m159	PINTEL	And he's got Old Bill's courage. A curse on him and you!
m159	BARBOSSA	Looks like your back to having nothing to offer.
m159	BARBOSSA	Now.  No don't kill him.
m159	PINTEL	Now?
m159	ELIZABETH	Will -- you can't trust him.
m159	BARBOSSA	Agreed.  You have my word as a gentleman of fortune --
m159	BARBOSSA	Aye.  And not a bit of it any use to us only hoarded.  But it will drive us no longer.
m159	ELIZABETH	The curse drove you to gather this?
m159	BARBOSSA	It's a piece of the treasure of Isla de Muerta.
m159	ELIZABETH	It's a pirate medallion.
m159	BARBOSSA	Do you not know what this is then?
m159	BARBOSSA	Would that I could.
m159	ELIZABETH	Then why aren't you eating?
m159	BARBOSSA	Oh there would be no sense in killing you Miss Turner.
m159	BARBOSSA	Now none of that.  Please dig in.
m159	ELIZABETH	Dare I ask the fate of it previous owner?
m159	BARBOSSA	Maid or not it fits you.
m159	BARBOSSA	It's you who invoked the parlay! Believe me Miss you'd best hand it over now ... or these be the last friendly words you'll hear!
m159	ELIZABETH	Can I trust you?
m159	BARBOSSA	No no nothing like that.  Very well.  You hand that over we'll put your town to our rudder and ne'er return.
m159	ELIZABETH	Of course.  I didn't steal it if that's what you mean.
m159	BARBOSSA	And how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that?  A family heirloom perhaps?
m159	ELIZABETH	Thank you sir.
m159	BARBOSSA	You've got sand for a maid.
m159	ELIZABETH	Elizabeth --  Turner.  I'm a maid in the governor's household. 
m159	BARBOSSA	You have a name missy?
m159	BARBOSSA	Did you now?
m159	ELIZABETH	Because it's what you're searching for.  You've been searching for it for years.  I recognize this ship. I saw it eight years ago when we made the crossing from England.
m159	BARBOSSA	My holds are bursting with swag. That bit of shine matters to me ... Why?
m159	ELIZABETH	I'll drop it!
m159	ELIZABETH	Very well.
m159	BARBOSSA	I am disinclined to acquiesce to your request.  Means 'No.'
m159	ELIZABETH	I want you to leave.  And never come back.
m159	BARBOSSA	There was a lot of long words in there miss and we're not but humble pirates.  What is it you want?
m159	ELIZABETH	Captain Barbossa ... I have come to negotiate the cessation of hostilities against Port Royal.
m159	BARBOSSA	My apologies miss.  As you were saying before you were so rudely interrupted?
m159	ELIZABETH	Well I am not going to stay hidden in some cabin or I suppose it's going to be heaving bosoms and bare for the remainder of the voyage!
m159	NORRINGTON	That would hardly be proper.
m159	ELIZABETH	Then I can wear men's clothing.
m159	NORRINGTON	You may seclude yourself in my cabin.  I'm afraid we do not have any ladies' clothing aboard.
m159	NORRINGTON	I know where your heart truly lies.
m159	ELIZABETH	What?
m159	NORRINGTON	Elizabeth I hereby withdraw my proposal.
m159	ELIZABETH	Not as a condition -- a request.
m159	NORRINGTON	I am to understand that you will accept my marriage proposal on the condition I rescue Mr. Turner?
m159	ELIZABETH	Commodore I beg you -- please do this ... for me.  As a wedding gift.
m159	ELIZABETH	Commodore please!
m159	NORRINGTON	Your father is frantic with worry. Our mission was to rescue you and return home.  That is what we shall do.  Mr. Turner's fate is regrettable.  But so was his decision to engage in piracy.
m159	ELIZABETH	No.  The pirates have taken Will --
m159	ELIZABETH	He can locate Isla de Muerta -- but I doubt he'll be willing to help us from the brig.
m159	NORRINGTON	You're speaking up for him again?
m159	ELIZABETH	Commodore you can't do that!
m159	NORRINGTON	Elizabeth I'm relieved you're safe.  Clap him in irons.  And behind his back this time.
m159	ELIZABETH	Yes I'm all right I'm fine!  Go capture him.
m159	NORRINGTON	On his heels!  Gillette bring a squad down from the fort!  Elizabeth are you --
m159	NORRINGTON	One good deed is not enough to redeem a man of a lifetime of wickedness.
m159	ELIZABETH	Commodore I must protest.  Pirate or not this man saved my life.
m159	NORRINGTON	I'm a bit nervous myself --
m159	ELIZABETH	I can't breathe.
m159	NORRINGTON	I apologize if I seem forward -- but I must speak my mind.  This promotion confirms that I have accomplished the goals I set for myself in my career.  But it also casts into sharp relief that which I have not achieved.  The thing all men most require: a marriage to a fine woman.  You have become a fine woman Elizabeth.
m159	NORRINGTON	Very good.
m159	ELIZABETH	His name is Will Turner -- that's all I found out.
m159	NORRINGTON	Did he speak?
m159	NORRINGTON	Fetch a hook -- haul him out of there!
m159	ELIZABETH	Boy overboard!
m159	NORRINGTON	Man overboard!
m159	NORRINGTON	Think again Miss Swann. Vile and dissolute creatures the lot of them. I intend to see to it that any man who sails under a pirate flag or wears a pirate brand gets what he deserves: a short drop and a sudden stop.
m159	ELIZABETH	I think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate.
m159	ELIZABETH	About the day we met. Do you remember?
m159	SWANN	Elizabeth this is hardly appropriate --
m159	ELIZABETH	Women in London must have learned to not breathe.
m159	SWANN	I'm told that dress is the very latest fashion in London.
m159	ELIZABETH	Difficult ... to say.
m159	SWANN	Or rather Commodore Norrington ... a fine gentleman don't you think?  He fancies you you know.
m159	ELIZABETH	I knew it.
m159	SWANN	Captain Norrington's promotion ceremony.
m159	ELIZABETH	Ceremony?
m159	SWANN	Although ... I did think you could wear it to the ceremony today.
m159	SWANN	Is an occasion necessary for a father to dote upon his daughter with gifts?
m159	ELIZABETH	It's -- beautiful. May I inquire as to the occasion?
m159	ELIZABETH	Yes -- yes.
m159	SWANN	Elizabeth? Is everything all right? Are you decent?
m159	ELIZABETH	Yes father.
m159	SWANN	And that's what concerns me. Elizabeth we will be landing in Port Royal soon and beginning our new lives. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we comport ourselves as befits our class and station?
m159	ELIZABETH	Actually I find it all fascinating.
m159	PINTEL	He said you say that!  He also said if that be the case you'll be dining with the crew and you'll be naked.
m159	ELIZABETH	Tell the captain that I am disinclined to acquiesce to his request.
m159	PINTEL	You'll be dining with the Captain and he requests you wear this.
m159	PINTEL	It would appear so do you.
m159	ELIZABETH	If an adversary demands parlay you can do them no harm until the parlay is complete.
m159	PINTEL	I know the code.
m159	ELIZABETH	Parlay!  I invoke the right of parlay!  According to the Code of the Brethern set down by the pirates Morgan and Bartholomew you must take me to your Captain!
m159	PINTEL	What?
m159	WILL	-- but that was not a proper kiss.
m159	ELIZABETH	It doesn't!
m159	WILL	Elizabeth I think it doesn't matter that we are of a different class --
m159	ELIZABETH	There.  And don't you dare tell me that wasn't a proper kiss!
m159	ELIZABETH	I guess you can never truly know someone else's heart.
m159	WILL	I can't believe he would make such a sacrifice for us.
m159	ELIZABETH	-- then we never would have met.
m159	WILL	If I had known --
m159	ELIZABETH	To keep it away from them?  No pirate would sail to London for fear of Execution Dock.
m159	WILL	Why would my father send this to me?
m159	ELIZABETH	Truthfully -- you were a bit late.
m159	WILL	I'm glad we got here in time.
m159	WILL	At least once more Miss Swann. As always.
m159	ELIZABETH	Will how many times must I ask you to call me 'Elizabeth'?
m159	WILL	I could never forget it Miss Swann.
m159	ELIZABETH	What's your plan?
m159	JACK	I have a plan.  If it succeeds then any battle will be decidedly brief ... and one-sided.
m159	ELIZABETH	These men will be facing an enemy that seemingly cannot be killed.
m159	JACK	Exactly.
m159	ELIZABETH	He might delay the rescue ... and that would be too late.
m159	JACK	Nor did you I noticed.
m159	ELIZABETH	You didn't tell Commodore Norrington everything.
m159	ELIZABETH	Exactly.
m159	JACK	You -- you burned up the island for a one-time chance at being spotted?
m159	ELIZABETH	That signal is over a thousand feet high which means it can be seen for two hundred leagues in every direction.  The entire Royal Navy is out to sea looking for me -- do you think there is even a chance they could miss it?
m159	ELIZABETH	One because it is a vile drink that turns even the most respectable men into scoundrels. Two --
m159	JACK	Why?
m159	ELIZABETH	Yes the rum is gone.
m159	JACK	What are you doing?  You've burned our food the shade -- the rum!
m159	JACK	To the Black Pearl.
m159	ELIZABETH	To freedom.
m159	JACK	We've got a few bottles left ... and we've yet to tap the kegs.
m159	ELIZABETH	Mr. Sparrow!  I'm not sure I've had enough rum to allow that kind of talk.
m159	JACK	Ah well ... the company is better than last time.  And the scenery has definitely improved.
m159	ELIZABETH	Jack it must be so terrible for you to be trapped here on this island all over again.
m159	ELIZABETH	You'll be positively the most fearsome pirates to sail the Spanish Main.
m159	JACK	When I get the Black Pearl back I'm going to teach it to the whole crew and we'll sing it all the time!
m159	JACK	More to drink!
m159	ELIZABETH	Well perhaps ... with a bit more to drink I might ...
m159	JACK	Now I must hear this song.  An authentic pirate song.  Have at it.
m159	ELIZABETH	That was before I met one of course.
m159	ELIZABETH	Oh no ... it's silly.  Back in England we didn't know a thing about pirates really.  They seemed so romantic and daring --
m159	JACK	I know a lot of songs about pirates but none I'd teach a child.  Let's hear it.
m159	ELIZABETH	Nothing ... it's nothing.  Just ... I'm reminded of a song I learned as a child.  A song about pirates.
m159	JACK	What?  What was that?  Something funny Miss Swann? Share please.
m159	ELIZABETH	Drink up me hearties yo ho ...
m159	ELIZABETH	Not when you can drink instead at least.
m159	JACK	Don't be thinking I'm happy about this Elizabeth.  But I see no use in wailing and gnashing my teeth over that which I can do nothing about.
m159	JACK	You're right.  Here's luck to you Will Turner.
m159	ELIZABETH	A month?  Will doesn't have a month!  We've got to do something to help him!
m159	JACK	You should look at our contretemps this way: we've got shade trees thank the Lord.  We've got some food on the trees thank the Lord again.  And we've got rum praise the Lord.  We can stay alive a month maybe more.  Keep a weather eye open for passing ships and our chances are fair.
m159	JACK	Welcome to the Caribbean love.
m159	ELIZABETH	So that's it?  That's the secret grand adventure of the infamous Jack Sparrow?  You spent three days on the beach drinking rum?
m159	JACK	Last time I was here a grand total of three days.  Last time the rumrunners who used this island as a cache came by and I bartered passage off.  But from the looks of this they've been out of business and so that won't be happening again.  We probably have your friend Norrington to thank for that.
m159	ELIZABETH	But ... you did it before!  Last time --
m159	JACK	It won't.  It won't and so we won't.
m159	ELIZABETH	What?  What's wrong?  How will this help us get off the island?
m159	JACK	Don't be thinking I'm not already working on it.
m159	ELIZABETH	Captain Sparrow!  We have to get off this island -- immediately!
m159	JACK	The trees are taller.
m159	ELIZABETH	Has it changed since the last time you were here?
m159	JACK	No.  This won't work.  I'll stay behind and fight them. You go on.
m159	ELIZABETH	Come on!
m159	JACK	No I'm -- rescuing you.
m159	ELIZABETH	You're in league with Barbossa!
m159	JACK	Me!
m159	ELIZABETH	You?!
m159	JACK	I saved your life; now you've saved mine.  We're square.
m159	ELIZABETH	You are despicable.
m159	JACK	Miss Swann if you'll be so kind?
m159	ELIZABETH	Miss Swann.
m159	JACK	Ah that's a dark and unpleasant tale best left untold.
m159	GIBBS	How did you get off the island?
m159	JACK	We're catching up!
m159	GIBBS	What's in your head to put you in such a fine mood?
m159	JACK	She can hold a bit longer.
m159	GIBBS	We'd best drop canvas sir!
m159	JACK	That he is.
m159	GIBBS	Kid's a bit of a stick isn't he?
m159	GIBBS	And you've got that have you?
m159	JACK	Not if the fool has something Barbossa wants.  Something he needs.
m159	GIBBS	A fool's errand.
m159	JACK	Aye and that's why I know where it's going to be and that's why I know what Barbossa is up to.  All I need is a crew.
m159	GIBBS	Jack it's a fool's errand: You've heard the tales they tell about the Pearl.
m159	JACK	I'm going after the Black Pearl. I know where it's going to be and I'm going to take it.
m159	GIBBS	Say again?
m159	JACK	Now where I wonder would they have gotten that idea?
m159	GIBBS	Oh there's a hard tale Jack. Most of the decent pirates in town won't sail with you -- seem to think you're a jinx.
m159	JACK	First -- have you found me a crew?
m159	GIBBS	Make it last then.  Now what's the nature of this venture of yours?
m159	GIBBS	Aye that'll about do it.
m159	JACK	Well fortunately I know how to counter it.  The man who did the waking buys the man who was sleeping a drink and the man who was sleeping it drinks it while listening to a proposition.
m159	GIBBS	Curse you for breathing you slack- jawed idiot.  Mother's love Jack you know better than to wake a man when he's sleeping.  It's bad luck!
m159	GIBBS	Will -- it'll go worse for us -- for Elizabeth especially -- if we fight.
m159	WILL	We can at least fight -- we might be able to kill a few--
m159	GIBBS	That we are.
m159	WILL	We're not going to just surrender!
m159	GIBBS	It's a signal.  If we resist it won't just be death.  There'll be torture as well.
m159	WILL	How did he get off the island?
m159	GIBBS	Jack gave hisself up for the sake of his loyal crew.  He was marooned on an island left there to die.
m159	GIBBS	Ah -- he's learned then.  Plays things more close to the vest. See Jack was a cartographer back in Old England.  Somehow he came by the money to commission the Pearl. Hired himself a crew promised each man an equal share.  So they're forty days out and the First Mate says everything's an equal share that should mean the location of the island too.  So Jack gave up the bearings.  That night there was a mutiny.
m159	WILL	What?  He never told me that.
m159	GIBBS	I'll tell lee.  Now Jack Sparrow has an honest streak in him and that's where the whole problem starts.  This was when he was Captain of the Black Pearl --
m159	WILL	Really?  So ... what's the story on the pistol?
m159	GIBBS	Now lad just because it don't point north don't mean it don't work.  That compass gives bearings to the Isla de Muerta wherever it may lay.
m159	WILL	How do we expect to find an island no one can find -- with a compass that doesn't work?
m159	WILL	I know.  That was for the smell.
m159	GIBBS	Blast it I'm already awake!
m159	NORRINGTON	I don't think that will be necessary.
m159	GILLETTE	Sir!  Shall I break out the cannons?
m159	NORRINGTON	Wait for my order -- what the blazes is that?
m159	GILLETTE	All the men in place sir.  Ready to fire.
m159	NORRINGTON	Better to see it at the bottom of the sea than in the hands of a pirate.
m159	GILLETTE	Hands!  Come about!  Jackets off the cannons!  We are to fire on our own ship?
m159	NORRINGTON	We need only to come about to put them in range of the long nines.
m159	GILLETTE	The wind is quarter from astern ... by the time we're underway we'll never catch them.
m159	NORRINGTON	Raise the sails.
m159	JACK	As likely as not.  Will short up the anchor we've got ourselves a ship!
m159	GILLETTE	Agreed.  You have the momentary advantage sir.  But I will see you smile from the yard arm sir.
m159	JACK	Fine by me.  We brought you a nice little boat so you can all get back to shore safe and sound.
m159	GILLETTE	Sir I'll not see any of my men killed or wounded in this foolish enterprise.
m159	JACK	We'll see about that.
m159	GILLETTE	You understand this ship cannot be crewed by only two men.  You'll never make it out of the bay.
m159	JACK	Dead serious.
m159	MURTOGG	I said no lies.
m159	JACK	None?  Very well.  You rumbled me. I confess: I intend to commandeer one of these ships pick up a crew in Tortuga and go on the account do a little honest pirating.
m159	JACK	Smith.
m159	MURTOGG	What's your name?
m159	JACK	That so?  I've heard of one supposed to be fast neigh uncatchable ... the Black Pearl?
m159	MURTOGG	Oh the Dauntless is the power in these waters true enough -- but there's no ship that can match the Interceptor for speed.
m159	JACK	That's a fine goal I'm sure ... But it seems to me a ship like that --  -- makes this one here just a wee superflous.
m159	JACK	This must be some important boat.
m159	MURTOGG	No ... somone has to make sure this dock stays off-limits to civilians.
m159	JACK	Some sort of to-do up at the fort eh?  You two weren't invited?
m159	JACK	Sorry I didn't know.
m159	MURTOGG	This dock is off-limits to civilians.
m159	JACK	I'll slip in talk them into to come out and you'll be free to blow holy high heaven the whole lot of them.
m159	NORRINGTON	I'll be at the wheel myself.
m159	JACK	That chart I drew up'll get you past the reefs.  If you're steersman's good enough that is.
m159	JACK	I knew you'd listen to reason!
m159	NORRINGTON	Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid of.
m159	JACK	They left me stranded.  Twice. What have you got to lose?
m159	NORRINGTON	You would do that?
m159	JACK	Funny I was thinking along those lines.  How about you let me go in alone and while you're setting up an ambush I'll trick the pirates out to you.
m159	NORRINGTON	I don't like the situation Mister Sparrow.  The island is riddled with caves.  I will not put my men at a disadvantage.
m159	NORRINGTON	By remembering that I serve others not only myself.
m159	JACK	Norrington think about it ... the Black Pearl its captain and crew ... the last pirate threat in the Caribbean.  How can you pass that up?
m159	NORRINGTON	We are bound for Port Royal not Isla de Muerta.
m159	JACK	We had time to get to know each other.
m159	NORRINGTON	Indeed.
m159	JACK	But it seems to be enough to condemn him.
m159	JACK	Ah but you have heard of me.
m159	NORRINGTON	Taking stock: you've got a pistol with only one shot a compass that doesn't point north ... and no ship.  You are without a doubt the worst pirate I have ever heard of.
m159	JACK	Captain Jack Sparrow.  If you please.
m159	NORRINGTON	Well well... Jack Sparrow isn't it?
m159	JACK	The worst.  On the other hand maybe I'm a man who can't pass up a chance for revenge against the black-hearted bastard who stole my ship and left me to die in the middle of the ocean -- twice! -- and who knows how to get what he wants.  Now that's a great pirate.
m159	WILL	Well you're the worst pirate I've ever heard of.  You're a man who can be trusted who can be counted on and who can't betray his friends.  What kind of pirate is that?
m159	JACK	-- and its guns and crew will cut you and your men to pieces the moment you step outside these caves.
m159	WILL	Jack!
m159	JACK	It's the right way.
m159	WILL	Are you certain this is the right way?
m159	JACK	Don't talk.  These caves magnify sound.  Just follow me.
m159	WILL	Jack!
m159	JACK	Do you have any idea where you're going?
m159	WILL	My name is Will Turner the son of Bootstrap Bill Turner.  His blood runs in my veins.  You need my blood.  And on my word I will pull this trigger and sink all the way down to Davy Jones' Locker!
m159	JACK	Will -- don't do anything stupid! Don't say anything stupid --
m159	JACK	I'm sure.  When you've led the kind of life that I have there are debts that must be paid.  Maybe I can balance the scales a little.
m159	WILL	Are you sure?  Jack -- this is not something you have to do.
m159	JACK	Go to the opposite end of the island and signal the ship.  I'll keep 'em busy.
m159	JACK	I'll lead them away.
m159	WILL	No.
m159	JACK	This way!
m159	WILL	Miss Swann!  We're here to rescue you!  It's going badly!
m159	JACK	On whether the stories are all true.  If they are that's a waterfall that spills over at high tide with a short drop to an underground lagoon.  If not --
m159	WILL	On what?
m159	JACK	Depends.
m159	WILL	What's that?
m159	WILL	Barbossa.
m159	JACK	But I survived.  And I still have that single shot.  It's meant for one man.  My mutinous first mate--
m159	JACK	The pistol.  When a pirate is marooned Will he's given a pistol with a single shot.  No good for hunting or surviving really.  But after three weeks of starvation and thrist -- the option of that pistol begins to look good.
m159	WILL	Wait -- what about the pistol?
m159	JACK	These are the only ones worth having.  And we're going to need them --
m159	WILL	Shut up before you lose them all!
m159	JACK	Don't worry.  I've already got a Quartermaster -- there!
m159	WILL	Just do it quickly.
m159	JACK	Oh -- did I forget to mention that?
m159	WILL	Tortuga?
m159	JACK	Then that's not much incentive for me to fight fair is it?
m159	WILL	You didn't beat me.  You ignored the rule of engagement.  In a fair fight I'd kill you.
m159	JACK	Put it away Will.  It's not worth getting beat again.
m159	WILL	My father -- was not -- a pirate!
m159	JACK	Sure -- because he could always go pirating.
m159	WILL	My father did not think of my mother -- his family -- as a burden.
m159	JACK	You think your father is the only man who ever lived the Glasgow life telling folk one thing and then going off to do another? There's quite a few who come here hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable life. And they're all 'merchant marines.'
m159	WILL	He was a merchant marine!  He was a respectable man who obeyed the law and followed the rules--
m159	JACK	Figured you wouldn't want to hear it.
m159	WILL	It's not true my father was a pirate.
m159	JACK	I swear you look just like him.
m159	WILL	That's not true.
m159	JACK	Good man.  Good pirate.  And clever -- I never met anyone with as clever a mind and hands as him. When you were puzzling out that cell door it was like seeing his twin.
m159	WILL	'Bootstrap?'
m159	JACK	I knew him.  Probably one of the few he knew him as William Turner. Most everyone just called him Bill or 'Bootstrap' Bill.
m159	WILL	My father.  William Turner?
m159	JACK	Is that so?
m159	WILL	I worked passage from England as a cabin boy.  After my mother passed I came out here ... looking for my father.
m159	JACK	For a man whose made an industry of avoiding boats you're a quick study.
m159	WILL	Aye!  Avast!
m159	JACK	Everybody stay calm.  We're taking over the ship!
m159	JACK	Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
m159	WILL	This is either crazy or brilliant.
m159	JACK	So's breaking a man out of jail. Face it Will: you may say you'll never be a pirate but you're off to a rip-roaring start.  My advice -- smile and enjoy it.
m159	WILL	It's still against the law.
m159	JACK	Commandeer.  We're going to commandeer a ship.  Nautical term.
m159	WILL	We're going to steal a ship?  That ship?
m159	JACK	No worries there.  She's far more likely to rot out from under us.
m159	WILL	I haven't set foot off dry land since I was twelve when the ship I was on exploded.  It's been a sound policy.
m159	JACK	Come aboard.
m159	JACK	Good.
m159	WILL	I'd die for her.
m159	JACK	My business Will.  As for your business -- one question or there's no use going.  This girl -- what does she mean to you?  How far are you willing to go to save her?
m159	WILL	Why are brothering with that?
m159	WILL	We need to go!
m159	JACK	Not without my effects.
m159	JACK	Agreed!
m159	WILL	Agreed.
m159	WILL	I helped build these cells.  Those are hook-and-ring hinges.  The proper application of strength the door'll lift free.  Just calls for the right lever and fulcrum ...
m159	JACK	How?  The key's run off.
m159	WILL	I can get you out of here.
m159	JACK	So it is that you found a girl. Well if you're intending to brave all and hasten to her rescue and so win fair lady's heart you'll have to do it alone.  I see no profit in it for me.
m159	WILL	Never.  They took Miss Swann.
m159	JACK	And you want to turn pirate yourself?
m159	WILL	Because you're a pirate.
m159	JACK	Why ask me?
m159	WILL	The ship's real enough.  So its anchorage must be a real place. Where is it?
m159	JACK	Surely you've heard the stories? The Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla de Mureta ... an island that cannot be found -- except by those who already know where it is.
m159	WILL	Where does it make berth?
m159	JACK	Somewhat.
m159	WILL	Are you familiar with that ship? The Black Pearl?
m159	WILL	No.  I can not just step aside and let you escape.
m159	JACK	Move!
m159	WILL	No.
m159	JACK	Move away.
m159	JACK	Pirate.
m159	WILL	You cheated.
m159	JACK	You need to find yourself a girl.  Or maybe the reason you practice three hours a day is you've found one -- but can't get her?
m159	WILL	I do.  And I practice with them. At least three hours a day.
m159	JACK	Who makes all these?
m159	JACK	Only a little.
m159	WILL	You threatened Miss Swann.
m159	JACK	Do you think this is wise boy? Crossing blades with a pirate?
m159	JACK	Ah.  Then it would be a shame to put a black mark on your record.  So if you'll excuse me ...
m159	WILL	I've made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates.
m159	JACK	You look familiar ... Have I ever threatened you before?
m159	MURTOGG	Still --
m159	MULLROY	Mentioned it is more what he did.
m159	MURTOGG	That Jack Sparrow ... he talked about the Black Pearl.
m159	MURTOGG	If he were telling truth he wouldn't have told us.
m159	MULLROY	He may be.
m159	MURTOGG	He's not telling the truth.
m159	MULLROY	I think he's telling the truth.
m159	MURTOGG	And no lies!
m159	MULLROY	What's your business in Port Royal 'Mr. Smith'?
m159	MULLROY	Like I said there's no real ship as can match -- Hey!
m159	MURTOGG	... no.
m159	MULLROY	Oh and no ship that's not crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out could possibly have black sails and therefore couldn't possibly be any ship other than the Black Pearl.  Is that what you're saying?
m159	MURTOGG	But I've seen a ship with black sails.
m159	MULLROY	No.
m159	MURTOGG	... No.
m159	MULLROY	You've seen a ship with black sails that's crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out?
m159	MURTOGG	Yes I have.
m159	MULLROY	You haven't seen it.
m159	MURTOGG	Yes.
m159	MULLROY	You've seen the Black Pearl?
m159	MURTOGG	Yes.
m159	MULLROY	You've seen it?
m159	MURTOGG	Yes it is.  I've seen it.
m159	MULLROY	No it's not.
m159	MURTOGG	The Black Pearl is a real ship.
m159	MULLROY	There's no *real* ship as can match the Interceptor.
m159	SWANN	Dammit man it appears someone is stealing your ship!
m159	NORRINGTON	Please.
m159	SWANN	But --
m159	NORRINGTON	A moment.
m159	SWANN	Commodore --
m159	NORRINGTON	Bleak.  Very bleak.
m159	SWANN	Well she had a very taxing day... Ghastly weather tonight.
m159	NORRINGTON	No.  She hasn't.
m159	SWANN	Has my daughter given you an answer yet?
m159	NORRINGTON	An explosion in the powder magazine. Merchant vessels run heavily armed.
m159	SWANN	What happened here?
m159	SWANN	Where did he come from?
m159	NORRINGTON	He's still breathing.
m159	NORRINGTON	My apologies Governor.
m159	SWANN	Captain Norrington... I appreciate your fervor but I am concerned about the effect this subject will have on my daughter.
m189	LIZ	Let me see.
m189	ADELE	Peter-- you took this picture?
m189	LIZ	Be nice.
m189	ADELE	And Flash isn't?
m189	ADELE	At least this ensemble doesn't glow in the dark.
m189	LIZ	Well look who's dressing for success.
m189	LIZ	Peter Parker you have no idea what I did this weekend.  Or didn't do. It's no business of yours either way.
m189	ADELE	Time to get my bowling ball re drilled.
m189	LIZ	Oh beware of jealousy my lord the green-eyed monster...
m189	ADELE	Sexual tension...
m189	BEN	I'm always here Pete.
m189	PETER	I know.
m189	BEN	When you won that scholarship I was proud of you.
m189	BEN	-- no I mean... we... your Aunt May not wantin' kids and all... I mean we both...
m189	PETER	Oh come on Ben that's not--
m189	BEN	Yeah ya like to do things on your own  I been thinkin' lately.  Maybe I wasn't the ya know greatest dad--
m189	PETER	No no.
m189	BEN	Cause if you get in a bind--
m189	PETER	Oh sure.
m189	BEN	Ya set for uh ya know-- money?
m189	BEN	Yeah Babe Ruth you wasn't.
m189	PETER	Remember Little League?
m189	BEN	S'funny.  When your mom and dad uh passed away I had this idea. I wanted you to be the best baseball player in the world.
m189	PETER	Nonot really.
m189	BEN	Ya still follow the Mets Pete?
m189	BEN	Eh.  If I ever get out from under. Maybe take May to France or somethin'.
m189	PETER	I know.  Still thinking about retiring?
m189	BEN	Wasn't worth gettin' upset over a Milky Way.  Anyways I was never much for ya know discipline.
m189	PETER	You stop him?
m189	BEN	Ah ya know.  Neighborhood's not what it used to be.  Kid no more'n five swiped a candy bar the other day.
m189	PETER	Same old stuff.  How's the pharmacy?
m189	BEN	So uh... how's college goin'?
m189	PETER	No. No that's okay.
m189	BEN	What want a glass?
m189	PETER	Uh Uncle Ben I--
m189	BEN	Here you go Pete.
m189	HARRY	Or was it all a dream?
m189	FLASH	See?
m189	HARRY	I was there.
m189	FLASH	-- but they got it all wrong.  Any fool can figure it out.  Spider-Man nailed this guy!
m189	HARRY	Flash drop it--
m189	FLASH	No no listen. They're tryin' to say he was in cahoots with this killer--
m189	HARRY	Yeah take pity on the feeble minded.
m189	FLASH	Come on laughter's the best medicine!
m189	LIZ	Flash get lost.
m189	LIZ	Hm.  What a lump.
m189	FLASH	Mistake?  Hey guy get back here!
m189	LIZ	I saw him too.  He was silly and obnoxious.
m189	FLASH	Hey guys.  Check it out-- I saw this dud on the tube last night. He is incredibly cool.
m189	FLASH	I'm parked illegally!
m189	LIZ	I was sort of hoping to get out of--
m189	FLASH	Lizzy!
m189	HARRY	Oh. Well hang in there amigo.
m189	PETER	Well I've missed a lot of classes myself...
m189	HARRY	Oh I need your notes from the classes I missed.
m189	HARRY	I got you a present.
m189	PETER	Listen I do appreciate your concern but--
m189	HARRY	You get mugged or something?
m189	PETER	You're not half the idiot I am Harry.
m189	HARRY	And you let me go on about Rosomoff working me too hard?  I feel like a complete idiot.
m189	PETER	Mm-hmm.
m189	HARRY	Jesus Christ.
m189	HARRY	I am not pitiful!  I am the bridge to the Übermensch!
m189	PETER	Don't be pitiful.
m189	HARRY	You're so responsible it's disgusting. But you're my only friend... do you hate me?
m189	HARRY	Why home? The real world beckons man!  The possibilities are endless.  Want to go up to the World Trade Center and laugh at New Jersey?
m189	PETER	Great idea.  Let me get some shoes. I'll take you home.
m189	HARRY	Screw scholarships!   Universities are death!  They make slaves of us all with their fetid ideas!  Burn 'em down I say!
m189	PETER	I know.  I've got one too.
m189	HARRY	"Scholarship students must maintain dignity at all times."""""
m189	PETER	Let me guess.  The hunting dogs. You lost your scholarship.
m189	HARRY	"Harry Osborne diminishes the stature of the University."""""
m189	PETER	Harry
m189	HARRY	Ooooh.  Your feet are on fire.
m189	PETER	Harry!
m189	HARRY	A little bunny I saved from dissection.
m189	PETER	What's in there?
m189	HARRY	They'll never take me alive.
m189	PETER	You maniac.  You'll blow your scholarship.
m189	PETER	Right.
m189	HOGAN	You can be great kid just stick with it. But let me give you one little piece of advice... be a good guy.
m189	PETER	Oh look Mr. Hogan I'm really sorry about what happened in there. Really--
m189	HOGAN	How are you doing kid?
m189	HOGAN	Get away from me freak!
m189	PETER	Are you okay?
m189	PETER	That's not even close.
m189	HOGAN	Lemme down bugface!
m189	PETER	Now tell me you love me.
m189	JAMESON	No!  Now get outta my face kid.
m189	PETER	Can I get a word in edgewise?
m189	JAMESON	No! Washington Square manhole covers turn into flying saucers and radios explode like A-bombs.  Did you get pictures?
m189	PETER	Mr. Jameson--
m189	JAMESON	Bunch of kids at your goddamned college say their appliances attacked them.  Did you get pictures?
m189	PETER	You print pictures of Bigfoot!
m189	JAMESON	I don't give a gerbil's ass how you got 'em!  I can't print this surreal garbage!
m189	PETER	Double-exposures? But they're not-- I was in--
m189	JAMESON	I got a question college boy.  What the hell am I supposed to do with these!?  I ask for disaster pathos what do I get?  Salvador Dali!  When I want artsy-fartsy double-exposures I'll ask for--
m189	PETER	Mr. Jameson--
m189	JAMESON	I like enthusiasm.  That's why I use a lot of smart-ass kids.  Not just 'cause they work cheap.
m189	PETER	Well thanks.  You wouldn't believe what I went through to get those. Right after you took my camera this ambulan--
m189	JAMESON	I bet you don't think I appreciate you Parker.  I do.
m189	JAMESON	Gimme that.  Pick it up later.
m189	PETER	Can't focus...
m189	JAMESON	Seventy.  But I want blood and gore.  You know sexy stuff.
m189	PETER	Can we make it a hundred?
m189	JAMESON	Get inside and get pictures.  Fifty bucks.
m189	PETER	Yeah--
m189	JAMESON	Parker-- you go here right?  Got your camera?
m189	PETER	You taking extension classes Mr. Jameson?
m189	JAMESON	You make your own luck Parker! Get into the middle of things spend every day pounding the pavement of the city's mean streets--
m189	PETER	Come on that's pure luck!  The guy was in the right place at the right time--
m189	PETER	I think you're trying to tell me something.
m189	JAMESON	Too hip.  Your photos suck kid.
m189	JAMESON	Hmf-hrr?
m189	SPIDER-MAN	Oh that?  It'll come unstuck in a half-hour or so. Your mouth needs the rest.  Bye.
m189	SPIDER-MAN	Fine.
m189	JAMESON	Frmpph-yrr.
m189	SPIDER-MAN	Thank you.  Now repeat after me-- Spider-Man is a good guy. On the side of right and niceness and cute baby animals and all that.
m189	JAMESON	Police help!  Po-- mmph.
m189	SPIDER-MAN	Would you cool it already?
m189	JAMESON	I don't submit to blackmail!  The first amendment protects my freedom to tell the news as I imagine it and--
m189	SPIDER-MAN	Relax Jameson.  This is business. I know you want photos of me so I'll give your boy Parker an exclusive.  On one condition--
m189	PETER	Deal.  But don't tell anyone.  I want to keep a low profile.
m189	LEIBER	An even five I throw in the jacket.
m189	PETER	Two suits by tomorrow for $400?
m189	LEIBER	You're making my life difficult.
m189	PETER	How about tomorrow?
m189	LEIBER	Eh.  Week from tomorrow.
m189	PETER	A spider.  Eight legs.
m189	LEIBER	What's this? A cockaroach?
m189	PETER	Uh-huh. Look this should be skintight.  Bright colors.  Red maybe a deep midnight blue.
m189	LEIBER	No refund on the mask y'know. Health laws.
m189	SPIDER-MAN	Just about.  See I also have this amazing strength.
m189	LETTERMAN	Are you quite finished?
m189	SPIDER-MAN	Just about.  You see I also have this amazing strength...
m189	LETTERMAN	All right amazing.  Are you quite finished?
m189	SPIDER-MAN	Well...
m189	LETTERMAN	I'll hate myself in the morning for asking but what exactly makes you any more amazing than the average jerk on the street?
m189	SPIDER-MAN	Thanks I already ate.
m189	LETTERMAN	Can I get you a snack-- a housefly maybe?
m189	SPIDER-MAN	Just call me Spidey.
m189	LETTERMAN	I see.  So Amazing Spider-Man-- I'll assume that's not your given name--
m189	SPIDER-MAN	Sorry. I'm still getting the hang of this.
m189	LETTERMAN	Is that bug juice or are you just glad to see me?
m189	MAY	What if the world ends tomorrow?
m189	LIZ	What if you get hurt?
m189	MAY	Even if you've heard them a million times in every stupid pop song ever written.
m189	LIZ	Even if they're not clever.
m189	MAY	Some things you should say anyway.
m189	LIZ	He knew.
m189	MAY	Maybe I was hiding.  For years I never told Ben the one important thing.
m189	LIZ	I don't think he wants me to find him.
m189	MAY	When Peter was little he loved to hide.  In closets under the sink. He needed a secret place.  But when I'd look for him he'd laugh... he wanted to be found.
m189	LIZ	He left.  I couldn't believe it-- he just left!  It's as if he's somewhere else... I'm only getting a piece of him.
m189	PETER	Nah.
m189	LIZ	This may be the end of a beautiful friendship you know.
m189	LIZ	Why?
m189	PETER	Hold it.  Can we stop being clever just for a moment?
m189	LIZ	Hm.  Well I like you too.  I like your aunt.  I like your shoelaces. I like--
m189	PETER	I... I like you.  A lot.
m189	LIZ	Hello.  So very boring.  Peter Parker how do you feel about me this morning?
m189	PETER	Hello Liz.
m189	PETER	I'm here...
m189	LIZ	Peter?
m189	LIZ	Her cleverness that hard edge-- maybe they're the weakest part of her. The strong part is what's underneath.  The part she was protecting.  There's no reason to protect it... I think she's just finding that out now.
m189	PETER	Strong...
m189	LIZ	Ssh.  I always thought she was a strong person.  She is-- but not for the reasons I thought.
m189	PETER	Oh God I forgot to--
m189	LIZ	May's much better. She'll be out soon.
m189	LIZ	Just shut up and close your eyes. This'll hurt.
m189	PETER	I'm sorry about being a jerk this afternoon.
m189	PETER	Unh-huh.  Excuse me.  I've gotta go.
m189	LIZ	Hello.  Earth to Peter.  Are you listening?
m189	LIZ	I know what you mean.  I...
m189	PETER	Am I?  I'm not so sure.  I used to be sure of a lot of things.  Oh different things from week to week but now-- I'm not sure of anything anymore.
m189	LIZ	Listen.  You think you're responsible for everything that happens.  Don't flagellate yourself - and don't flatter yourself either.  You're not the center of the universe. You're just... Peter.
m189	PETER	You'd feel what?
m189	LIZ	"So?  The next day I'd read ""Peter Parker murdered and I'd feel..."
m189	PETER	Well, no.
m189	LIZ	You're not trained for that.  None of us are... I mean, sometimes I...  Okay, let's say you had gone back. What then?  Are you bulletproof?
m189	PETER	They keep saying there's nothing I could've done.  That's a lie.  I could've done something.  If only I'd paid attention to my feelings.
m189	PETER	I think I'd like that.
m189	LIZ	Do you mind if I come too?
m189	PETER	-- but at least Aunt May's okay now. I really have to stop by the hospital this afternoon.
m189	PETER	That was then.  I'm better since the lobotomy.
m189	LIZ	This from a man who winces at the cost of a pretzel?
m189	PETER	No, it wasn't only you-- it -- it just wasn't my style.  Hey, look-- let's go to lunch.  Someplace nice for a change.
m189	LIZ	Oh, don't do it on my account--
m189	PETER	Sort of.  I'm returning the-- that outfit that you hated so much. Maybe I can get my money back.
m189	LIZ	What's in the bag?  Garbage?
m189	LIZ	That wasn't clever.  That was just nasty.
m189	PETER	This from a girl who still plays with dolls.
m189	LIZ	Sit down and stop being such a child.
m189	PETER	I've got no problems.
m189	LIZ	What's your problem?
m189	PETER	Don't misquote Othello at me. Besides, you'd have to care about somebody to strangle them.
m189	PETER	I'm sure you kept warm.
m189	LIZ	Brrr.  It's colder than New Hampshire in here.
m189	PETER	Hi, Adele.
m189	LIZ	Eat alone, gotta read. Social defense tactic 17  Peter, that jacket is foul.  Lose your glasses?
m189	LIZ	Oh. Maybe I should, too--
m189	PETER	I've gotta study.
m189	LIZ	What are you doing this weekend?
m189	LIZ	Hurry up, Flash!
m189	PETER	I'd never admit that.
m189	LIZ	"Eugene.  Admit it, Peter-- you'd do anything for a nickname like Flash."""
m189	PETER	Does it have a human name?
m189	LIZ	Some prep school thing.
m189	PETER	"Flash Liz.  You're going out with something that calls itself Flash."""""
m189	LIZ	You should write that one down.
m189	PETER	But you like that in a man?
m189	LIZ	God Flash can be such a jerk.
m189	PETER	What?
m189	LIZ	You want to give them something but they'll just buy more Ripple. And they smell so... bad.
m189	PETER	I suppose.
m189	LIZ	Yeah.  Really gets to you if you let it.
m189	PETER	My my.
m189	LIZ	Since you're feeling guilty why not donate your pretzel to somebody who needs it?
m189	PETER	Maybe.  I could have stopped it though.
m189	LIZ	He'll weasel out of trouble. Again.
m189	PETER	Back to the lab.  Harry'll probably lose his scholarship.
m189	LIZ	Poor Harry.  Always desperate for attention.  What about the bunny?
m189	PETER	-- but the dogs treed him between Huxley and Kafka.
m189	PETER	Thank God.
m189	LIZ	No.  I was lying about the coffee.
m189	LIZ	I hate your relatives I hate your coffee I hate your shoes.
m189	PETER	I hate--
m189	LIZ	I hate people with alliterative names.
m189	PETER	I hate the Platonic idea of you.
m189	LIZ	Oh.  Well I hate you and everyone who looks like you.
m189	PETER	I lov-loathe Elizabeth Allan. Abhor detest despise--
m189	LIZ	Uh is a good start.
m189	PETER	I-- uh--
m189	LIZ	"Fill in the blank: """"I blank Elizabeth Allan."""""
m189	PETER	Huh?
m189	LIZ	It's never too early to be clever. Describe in a sentence how you feel about me.
m189	PETER	It's too early to be clever.
m189	LIZ	How very dull Peter Parker.
m189	PETER	Good morning Liz.
m189	ROZ	Precise equipment such as waldos
m189	MAROTTA	Roz? Rosomoff?  What is it?
m189	MAROTTA	Nope.  Maybe he skipped to Rio. Feds got troops surrounding every cyclotron on the continent.  Are you absolutely positive that one at E.S.U. is kaput?
m189	ROZ	Any sign of our friend?
m189	MAROTTA	Yeah Roz.
m189	ROZ	Peter-- my condolences.
m189	MAROTTA	Einstein right?  We'll see ya.
m189	ROZ	"No such thing as coincidence.  """"God does not play dice with the universe."""""
m189	MAROTTA	It's a lot of ground to cover. We'll try.  Funny coincidence huh?
m189	ROZ	Of course.
m189	ROZ	I know him.
m189	MAROTTA	You sure about all this?
m189	ROZ	And he'll need a cyclotron.  He can't use ours-- he's already destroyed it.  Guard every nuclear accelerator on the Eastern Seaboard.  New Haven Long Island two in Cambridge--
m189	MAROTTA	Toxic dumps huh.
m189	ROZ	There's an infinitely greater danger. If--  Listen.  The only thing Octavius cares about is repeating his experiment.  To do that he needs a radioactive catalyst SL 270.
m189	MAROTTA	Yeah that's fascinating but I'm just a fat dumb cop lookin' for a psycho killer--
m189	ROZ	Lieutenant I've triangulated recent bizarre events-- the Bronx Jersey Brooklyn-- all rippling out from--  Here.  The E.S.U. Science Center. Octavius' experiment seems to have opened a hole in space-time drastically changing the interrelation between molecular binding electromagnetism and gravity--
m189	MAROTTA	Right. We have reason to believe he also robbed an armored truck and killed two men. With the waldos.
m189	ROZ	Waldos.
m189	MAROTTA	But you said he went off a little after the accident when those mechanical arms--
m189	ROZ	Octavius wasn't the murderer type.
m189	MAROTTA	Some of him char-broiled bones. Teeth. We ruled out suicide.  Any bad blood between him and Ock?
m189	ROZ	So you've found Thorkel?
m189	MAROTTA	You were the last one to see Thorkel.  In Octavius' hospital room.
m189	MAY	He'll be fine. They won't tell me anything but I'm sure he'll be fine.
m189	PETER	How is he?
m189	MAY	I was napping on the couch.  There was a voice and a shot.  I woke up. Ben was looking at me.
m189	PETER	Aunt May what happened?
m189	MAY	Oh Ben gets through everything.
m189	PETER	It's fine.  Tell me what--
m189	MAY	Peter you're bleeding.
m189	MAY	See?  You big dullard.
m189	PETER	A match made in heaven.
m189	MAY	Use a fork.
m189	PETER	Funny thing happened after my physics class today. Harry Osborn--
m189	MAY	Absolutely no class.
m189	MAY	You were adorable.  The least you could do is use a glass.
m189	PETER	Oh not that.  You promised you'd burn it.
m189	MAY	Tofu.  Ben I wish you wouldn't.
m189	PETER	What the hell is that?
m189	MAY	It'll shut itself off.
m189	PETER	The record--
m189	PETER	No.
m189	MAY	Yes.  Do you have a date?
m189	PETER	It's Friday night...
m189	MAY	Anyway I've decided to kidnap you for dinner in Forest Hills--
m189	PETER	I'm a photographer remember?
m189	MAY	Ick.  And those foul chemicals in the pots--
m189	PETER	I'll introduce you.
m189	MAY	--but I didn't feel like getting to know your roaches.
m189	PETER	I am old enough to--
m189	MAY	Oh Peter. A zit.
m189	PETER	When I moved out you swore up and down you wouldn't meddle--
m189	MAY	Your records are older than you are.  Have you never heard of new wave?
m189	PETER	Aunt May you're trespassing.
m189	MAY	That's the understatement of the year.
m189	PETER	There's nothing in there worth stealing!
m189	PETER	Yeah a psychiatric hospital. Listen I'm serious--
m189	NURSE VOICE	Do ya? Lemme give you the number for Bellevue.  That's 561-5151--
m189	PETER	I mean I suddenly have immense physical power and the ability to crawl up walls--
m189	NURSE VOICE	Is this some sort of Zen thing?
m189	PETER	Hi.  I've got sort of a hypothetical question.  Do you suppose the bite of a radioactive spider would transmit that spider's proportional strength and agility?
m189	NURSE VOICE	Poison emergency.
m189	THORKEL	Doubtless.  And you'll have all the time in the world to pursue your work.   Somewhere else.
m189	OCK	I will finish what I've begun
m189	THORKEL	Then you'll be glad to know the University has decided not to press criminal charges against you. Breaking and entering the minor matter of the total destruction of a 23 million dollar cyclotron
m189	OCK	No!
m189	THORKEL	That Nobel Prize will just have to wait.
m189	OCK	I don't care.  Cretin.
m189	THORKEL	You've used up your grant. The electric bills alone exceed your annual salary.  Not to mention the potential hazards of your radioactive fuel.
m189	OCK	This is the unified field!  All the forces of the universe tied together-- perfectly!
m189	THORKEL	What you've done is make the entire physics department look foolish. You compare yourself to Einstein; your colleagues compare you to Bozo the Clown.
m189	OCK	I couldn't care less.  What I've done is--
m189	THORKEL	Then the alumni reports came in-- fund-raising is down this year.
m189	THORKEL	I've had an extremely bad day Octavius.  A sophomoric prank in the library and punitive measures.
m189	OCK	In this obsolete little cyclotron I'm solving the greatest physics problem of the 20th Century.  With more power I could--
m189	THORKEL	Let's talk in the hall.
m189	OCK	Proof.  Proof of a unified field. Not just theory and equations-- experimental proof.
m189	THORKEL	Power down.  I need to talk to you.
m189	OCK	Ha.  Anti-gravitational particles.
m189	ROZ	You have no right!  This is cosmic suicide!
m189	OCK	Truth.  Truth alone exists. Truth must be released...
m189	ROZ	My God Otto you have to hear me! The world we know will collapse! Everything we have devoted our lives to-- all patterns all harmonies-- will be destroyed!
m189	OCK	Oh Roz.  My mind is so far beyond yours now.  I could beat you at chess now.
m189	ROZ	Life and death matter. Yours-- everyone's.  By comparison our search for truth is only a product of curiosity a game--
m189	ROZ	No. It isn't.
m189	OCK	I'll repeat the experiment.  I will hold the truth. That's the only thing that matters.
m189	ROZ	Otto we are mere mortals. You must never forget your own limits--
m189	OCK	Truth. Pure eternal.  Beyond the boundaries of mere mortality.
m189	ROZ	Creation? Or its opposite?
m189	OCK	You're wrong.  Just for a moment I heard saw felt-- I became Creation.
m189	ROZ	All right we may be insignificant imperfect creatures-- but we're all we've got.
m189	OCK	My self.  I don't matter.  This human life all life- insignificant.  Bodies-- bags of sleepy sluggish flesh.
m189	OCK	Ach theories!  This was first hand experiential knowledge the essence of the universe.
m189	ROZ	A bit melodramatic but if you could prove it that would tie in your unified field theory the Big Bang Kaluza-Klein--
m189	OCK	I left a paper in my desk.
m189	ROZ	I heard about Thorkel's order--
m189	OCK	No.  No thank you.  I have work.
m189	ROZ	Perhaps. But every now and then someone pays attention.  You did.
m189	OCK	Rosomoff I have better things to do than teach Introductory Physics to mindless adolescents.
m189	ROZ	Otto I don't like Thorkel any more than you do.  But he has got a point.
m189	ROZ	If you really apply yourself you'll get an A next time.
m189	PETER	Oh. Yeah.  Thanks.
m189	ROZ	The paper my boy.  A solid B-plus.
m189	PETER	I'll try. Thanks.
m189	ROZ	You never know.  Go get some sleep.
m189	PETER	I don't think I'll be running into him.
m189	ROZ	Really.  I'd like to speak with him.
m189	PETER	Luck.  The right place at the right time.
m189	ROZ	"This photo you took of """"Spider-Man"""" -"
m189	ROZ	No thank you.  I'm sure you've got your own problems.
m189	PETER	Need any more help?
m189	ROZ	Only Octavius knows for sure.  And last time I spoke to him he was on the planet Whiz-Bang.
m189	PETER	Not a lot.  I saw inside of the Science Center.  What exactly happened?
m189	ROZ	How much do you know about it?
m189	PETER	Caused by Doc Ock's experiment?
m189	ROZ	Fortean phenomena.  Anomalies in our so-called reality. Weirdness my boy and lots of it.
m189	PETER	Really Professor I--
m189	ROZ	Pretty lame for such a smart kid.
m189	PETER	Actually I got this spider bite
m189	ROZ	Your dog ate it.
m189	PETER	An extension on that astronomy paper?  Because uh...
m189	ROZ	Peter what can I do for you?
m189	PETER	Hi Professor.  What's up?
m189	ROZ	Mr. Parker.
m189	REISS	Letterman show NBC. We'll talk then.  Bye.
m189	PETER	Why? It is a wrestling match or
m189	REISS	Good. We'll make it oral for now. Meet me at Rockefeller Center at six tonight.
m189	PETER	No
m189	REISS	I was hoping you'd call babe. Look you got representation?
m189	PETER	Hello uh Mr. Reiss?  I'm-- I'm the guy who wrestled Hulk Hogan the other day.  The guy in the mask?
m189	PETER	Oh-- I don't know-- thanks Mr. Reiss but--
m189	REISS	Kid you were terrific.  Max Reiss novelty acts.  Was that judo or something?  Ah skip it.  Question is can you do it again?
m189	REISS	I just gave-- yeah sure.
m189	SPIDER-MAN	Mr. Reiss-- I need a quarter--
m189	REISS	Okay kid. Call me tomorrow.
m189	SPIDER-MAN	No.  No I-- my aunt and uncle. Something's wrong  --  I need to make a phone call.
m189	REISS	I asked if you felt like a drink--
m189	SPIDER-MAN	What?
m189	REISS	... a couple a drinks at Sardi's?
m189	REISS	Yup.  Oh here's your check minus my commission.  Solid solid novelty act.
m189	SPIDER-MAN	So they're airing this tonight?
m189	REISS	Nah.  The big mask was better.
m189	SPIDER-MAN	Like it?
m189	REISS	Where'd you get the clown suit?
m189	ROZ	No no!  Not there!
m189	SPIDER-MAN	Up here Docky Ocky!
m189	ROZ	Sure in the war.  Pull those cables--
m189	SPIDER-MAN	Professor you ever fly one of these things before?
m189	SPIDER-MAN	I'm not so happy myself.
m189	ROZ	Spider-Man be careful!  He's quite mad.
m189	SPIDER-MAN	Phooey on that.
m189	ROZ	I see.  Well Octavius won't get much further. They'll catch him and... put him away.  Sad.  He might very well have the truth.
m189	SPIDER-MAN	No but I've got this secret identity to worry about. I'll swing the rest of the way.
m189	ROZ	Do you... live around here?
m189	SPIDER-MAN	Just drop me off here.
m189	ROZ	Loonytunes.  And yet...
m189	SPIDER-MAN	Bonkers.
m189	ROZ	"I listened to him talk of eternal truth and thought of the Bhagavad Gita the Indian holy book-- """"I am become Shiva Death-- the destroyer of worlds.""""  Octavius was..."
m189	SPIDER-MAN	Forgive me if I don't feel too sympathetic right now.
m189	ROZ	A messianic complex is nothing new to Octavius. In  his universe there's only one mind-- his own. It must be very lonely.
m189	SPIDER-MAN	And blow up the universe just to prove he's right?  Bit egotistical isn't it?
m189	ROZ	He'll try to finish his experiment.
m189	SPIDER-MAN	The usual.  Heredity and environment.  What's the deal with Doc Ock?
m189	ROZ	Excuse me if I'm impertinent but-- how did you become whatever it is you are?
m189	SPIDER-MAN	Imagine how I feel.
m189	ROZ	Logic.  Lot 49 is the closest stockpile of SL 270--  I do feel foolish talking with a man dressed like a--
m189	SPIDER-MAN	Yeah just a lung full of New Jersey.  Lucky you showed up when you did.
m189	ROZ	You're sure you're all right.
m189	ROZ	Right.  Let's go.
m189	SPIDER-MAN	Explain that some jerk in a mask and costume fought a mad scientist with four tentacles?
m189	ROZ	I sent for  the police.  We can explain.
m262	KNOX	Actually I wanted to talk to Batman. Pass that on to Mr. Wayne would you?
m262	ALFRED	Mr. Wayne is out for the day.
m262	KNOX	Alexander Knox. Gotham Globe.
m262	ALFRED	Yes?
m262	KNOX	The small one.
m262	ALFRED	Which bathroom is that sir?
m262	KNOX	You know if you cut your bathroom in half you'd have my apartment.
m262	ALFRED	I'd say about thirty feet sir.
m262	KNOX	How high up would you say that is?
m262	BRUCE	If not for you I never would've made it. You know that. My own parents couldn't have...  ... The boy Alfred. You'll both be provided for. Don't let all this got to waste.
m262	ALFRED	Don't ever say that sir. Don't ever believe it.
m262	BRUCE	How long's it been Alfred? A quarter of a century?  It seems like yesterday. I guess we ended up doing more harm than good.
m262	ALFRED	Respectfully sir... there'll never be another one like you.
m262	BRUCE	I know the feeling. It won't last.  He's a long way ahead of where I was at his age.
m262	ALFRED	Upstairs. He's quite docile.
m262	BRUCE	Where's the boy?
m262	ALFRED	... Very good sir.
m262	BRUCE	It's all right Alfred. Everything's under control.
m262	BRUCE	Thank you Alfred.  I hope you'll excuse me.  It was a great pleasure meeting you.  And you.
m262	ALFRED	Excuse me sir.  Commissioner Gordon was compelled to leave - -very unexpectedly.  He asked me to convey his regrets.
m262	JOKER	Bruce we're both murderers. Think how many people you've killed by letting me live.
m262	BATMAN	... Murderer...
m262	JOKER	You know we should've sat down and had us a little heart-to-heart. I bet we would have got on famously.
m262	JOKER	Batman! Don't you even recognize your old pal Jack? After all...  ... You made me what I am today.
m262	BATMAN	What are you talking about?
m262	JOKER	Gosh I could kill you but then you'd miss my party. And you Batman -- you're the guest of honor!
m262	BATMAN	Take me. Let the boy go.
m262	JOKER	Like your boyfriend. He's kinda hot.
m262	BATMAN	I had to save you Vicki. I --  -- Please trust me.
m262	VICKI	You could've killed him you know. You could've killed the Joker.
m262	BATMAN	Is this what you wanted?
m262	VICKI	If you don't mind my asking... Who's close to you?
m262	BATMAN	I don't want to jeopardize anyone close to me.
m262	VICKI	I just can't absorb it all. This place the equipment. What it must have cost.  Why all the secrecy? Why do you wear the mask?
m262	BATMAN	No. Every product contains one component. The elements react in combination. Hair spray won't do it. But hair spray and perfume and lipstick will.  Untraceable. It's very elegant.
m262	VICKI	That can't be right. That would mean every shipment of every product is poisoned. We'd all be dead.
m262	BATMAN	They've got it all wrong. They're watching the warehouses the loading docks looking for a tamperer. The Joker is supplying tainted ingredients at the source.
m262	BATMAN	Photo database. I'll do your photos now.
m262	VICKI	What is that?
m262	BATMAN	So did I once. But I kept coming back and... I guess I became the thing I feared most.
m262	VICKI	I loathe bats.
m262	BATMAN	They don't come down here. They're afraid of the lights.
m262	BATMAN	Exploring. In the woods. Many years ago. -- I was a solitary child.
m262	VICKI	How'd you find this place?
m262	BATMAN	That's why I wear a target on my chest.
m262	VICKI	It doesn't protect your head though.
m262	BATMAN	Better. It's not on the market yet.
m262	VICKI	What is this stuff? Kevlar?
m262	VICKI	Well I've certainly enjoyed it. -- What's that?
m262	BATMAN	Quite a while. I took the scenic route.
m262	VICKI	... How long have I been out?
m262	VICKI	... Where are you taking me?
m262	BATMAN	Thank you Vicki.
m262	BATMAN	I'll take you with me.
m262	VICKI	How do I know you won't keep them all?
m262	BATMAN	All right I'll develop the photos. Anything I don't want is yours.
m262	VICKI	Look I appreciate what you did for me. But this is my job. And I'm keeping those pictures.
m262	BATMAN	The Joker is a murderer. And you were as good as dead. So --
m262	VICKI	I won't let you have it.
m262	BATMAN	Please.
m262	VICKI	I just wanted to distract them. I wasn't trying to get a picture of you.
m262	BATMAN	I'll have to ask you for that film.
m262	VICKI	Well -- I think you might consider
m262	BATMAN	...Not even a 'thank you'?
m262	VICKI	... A hundred and eight?
m262	BATMAN	How much do you weigh?
m262	BATMAN	Too many people. Come on!  SHIELDS!!
m262	VICKI	Can't we --
m262	BATMAN	He won't kill her. -- GODDAMMIT!
m262	VICKI	What about the girl?
m262	VICKI	Shouldn't we --
m262	BATMAN	I know. I called them.
m262	VICKI	Look! Police!
m262	VICKI	WHICH CAR?
m262	BATMAN	GET IN THE CAR!!
m262	BRUCE	Alfred bring something for Mr. Knox -- I'll have one too.
m262	KNOX	Yeah a drink. 'Civilized' right?
m262	BRUCE	Do you want a drink?
m262	KNOX	Because I...  ... Because she'd never speak to me again.
m262	BRUCE	Tell me Knox. If you've got the story why haven't you printed it?
m262	KNOX	See I don't know how it happened... she's a smart girl and you are an extraordinary screwed-up guy... but she's in love with you.
m262	KNOX	Then stay away from Vicki. That's all I want man. I just want your word.
m262	BRUCE	I can't do that. Not while the Joker's still at large.
m262	KNOX	I want you to hang up the suit. And I want you to stay away from Vicki.
m262	BRUCE	What is it you want?
m262	KNOX	That's how it is chum. One column - and I can bring all this tumbling down. I can take you off the streets for good.
m262	BRUCE	You're just back from Corto Maltese.  I saw your combat photos.  Quite a departure for you.
m262	KNOX	"This is Miss Vale."""" -- That felt redundant."
m262	BRUCE	I might consider it if you introduce me to Miss Vale.
m262	KNOX	Great.  Give me a grant.
m262	BRUCE	Bruce Wayne.  -- I've read your work.  I quite like it.
m262	KNOX	I assume in my usual charming manner I've just insulted the host.  Alexander Knox.
m262	BRUCE	Vicki. Do you love half of me? Or all of me?
m262	VICKI	I don't but... I do. It's just... I love you Bruce. I don't want you to...
m262	BRUCE	Ohhhh... You don't mean that.
m262	VICKI	I don't know why I'm doing this. I half wish you'd stay a cripple.
m262	BRUCE	In all these years... Why couldn't I see how it wold turn out?
m262	VICKI	I'm frightened of you Bruce. I'm frightened for you.
m262	BRUCE	All this apparatus Vicki... This house and the money and the power ... It was never mine. It was something I inherited. Bruce Wayne was something I inherited.  All I ever hoped for was someone who could see through Bruce -- who could see me -- and not be frightened.
m262	BRUCE	Hang on. I have to leave a message.
m262	VICKI	What now?
m262	BRUCE	Got it!
m262	BRUCE	I've had an automatic tracer on this number ever since he tracked you to the museum.
m262	VICKI	How can you do that if she's already off the line?
m262	BRUCE	Finding out where she is.
m262	VICKI	I'm sorry she hung up. What are --
m262	VICKI	... Where are you calling from?
m262	BRUCE	Keep her on the line!
m262	BRUCE	The does it. It's going to be this weekend.
m262	VICKI	"It worked for Van Gogh. Let's kiss and make up."""""
m262	BRUCE	I feel naked without it.
m262	VICKI	Oh Bruce. Don't tell me you carry it around with you.
m262	BRUCE	Very thoughtful. Don't touch it.
m262	VICKI	It's like the last time. He sent me a present before he --
m262	BRUCE	Sometimes... I don't know if there's enough of me left to save.
m262	VICKI	Bruce at the rate you're going you can't even save yourself.
m262	BRUCE	What if I could save a handful? -- What if I could save one?
m262	VICKI	You're one man. You can't save everybody.
m262	BRUCE	Money makes money Vicki. The foundation runs itself -- I'm extraneous to the process.
m262	VICKI	I don't understand it. You can do so much good for people. As Bruce Wayne.
m262	BRUCE	No one would miss me.
m262	VICKI	So we just pretend none of this ever happened. We never met. We --  -- You're going to get yourself killed Bruce. You know that don't you?
m262	VICKI	I'm serious Bruce. We have to -- !
m262	BRUCE	Who's this 'Bruce'? Are you trying to make me jealous?
m262	VICKI	... I know it's you Bruce. I'm not going to talk to you unless we can discuss it...
m262	BRUCE	Vicki?... This is Batman. I thought I'd call and see how you're doing.
m262	VICKI	I wish you'd...
m262	BRUCE	I realize... the way things have gone between us...  ... I wish you'd reconsider.
m262	VICKI	Well Bruce -- I don't think -- that would be possible.
m262	BRUCE	I'm sorry I had to stand you up today. I'd like to make it up to you.
m262	VICKI	Yes Bruce -- I'm here --
m262	BRUCE	I know it's late. I -- Are you there?
m262	BRUCE	... Looks like a convention.
m262	VICKI	All street mimes should be executed.
m262	VICKI	Mm-hmm.  Lunch.  Not even dinner.
m262	BRUCE	I said I'd call you the minute I got free.  And I did -- And here we are.
m262	VICKI	To tell you the truth I'd just about given up waiting.
m262	VICKI	Then there's one thing in the world you don't do very well. And I know what it is -- Now you'll have to kill me.
m262	BRUCE	I don't sing very well.
m262	VICKI	... We could try that.
m262	BRUCE	Maybe we should just kiss.
m262	VICKI	God.  You would.  Come on Bruce.  I just want to get two drinks in you.  As an experiment.
m262	BRUCE	I'll take you home if you'd like.
m262	VICKI	But it's not fair.  I'm half drunk and you're not even --
m262	BRUCE	Vicki if I say anything cryptic or... ambiguous I think you should put the most flattering possible interpretation on it.  Because even if it doesn't sound that way... that's how I'll mean it.
m262	VICKI	I'm sorry Bruce I Just can't seem to get a handle on this conversation.
m262	BRUCE	I see.  If I know how you really feel I won't like you as much.
m262	VICKI	As much as I do.  It's not that.  I don't want to be depressing that's all.
m262	BRUCE	In other words what right do I have to talk about terror.
m262	VICKI	Bruce really when I say these things I don't mean to criticize you.
m262	VICKI	Well Bruce some types are a little more obvious than others.
m262	BRUCE	There's terror everywhere.  If you train yourself to look for it.
m262	VICKI	... Terror.
m262	BRUCE	What did you see?
m262	VICKI	Well.  A couple of years ago when their president was requesting aid I went down there for Newsweek. The beaches were nice.  And at nights -- they had a band -- I danced on the hotel patio.  Of course I never saw what was really happening there. When the war broke out I had to go back. And I promised myself that this time... I wouldn't look away.
m262	BRUCE	Odd desire for anyone.
m262	VICKI	Neither had I.  Odd desire for a woman I guess.
m262	BRUCE	No.
m262	VICKI	That's a tough one.  Have you ever seen combat?
m262	BRUCE	Two drinks and I start swinging from the rooftops.  Look I bore myself silly.  Let's talk about you. How the hell did you wind up in Corto Maltese?
m262	BRUCE	Too much work.  I'm not really the physical type -- Thank you Alfred.
m262	VICKI	Do you sail?
m262	BRUCE	Good.  With any luck we'll run into each other.
m262	VICKI	As far as I know.
m262	BRUCE	I don't... seek publicity -- Will you be staying in Gotham for a while?
m262	DENT	I don't know. I'm just a D.A. I don't have access to all you expert sources.
m262	BRUCE	Do you still think the Joker cares about money??
m262	DENT	We've told him we'll deal. What could he possible have to gain by --
m262	BRUCE	Then for God's sake Harvey cancel the anniversary celebration.
m262	DENT	Good. A bomb. On a blind tip from Bruce Wayne -- We do have laws.
m262	BRUCE	I suggest a nice big bomb.
m262	DENT	All right Bruce what do you suggest?
m262	BRUCE	He'll be ready when you do. Remember what happened at the apartment.
m262	DENT	We'll raid the Ace the moment we get a warrant.
m262	DRIVER	It's a detour. They're backed up for blocks!
m262	JOKER	MOVE! Can't you do something??
m262	JOKER	They'll be sorry. They'll be sorry. MOVE OUT!
m262	DRIVER	Boss! Jesus! They've --
m262	DRIVER	WHAT??
m262	JOKER	SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE --
m262	DRIVER	WHAT?
m262	JOKER	SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE POWER!!
m262	JOKER	Take 'em! I want his head!
m262	DRIVER	We got 'em!
m262	ECKHARDT	About how pretty you are pretty boy.  Maybe he'd like to know --
m262	JACK	What are you talking about?
m262	ECKHARDT	Got it all figured huh?  Grissom just sits back and hands you the reins.  -- Maybe he don't know what we know.
m262	JACK	Why Eckhardt.  You should be thinking about the future.
m262	ECKHARDT	I answer to Grissom punk.  Not to you.
m262	JACK	Eckhardt... our problems are your problems.
m262	ECKHARDT	I'm on top of it.  If there's a problem --
m262	JACK	Don't let your job interfere with your business.  -- Someone's been talking to Harvey Dent.
m262	ECKHARDT	Sorry.  We had another bat sighting.
m262	JACK	I missed you Lieutenant.
m262	NICK	Do you want this money or don't you?  Now shut up!  Shut up --
m262	EDDIE	You shouldn'ta turned the gun on that kid man.  You shouldn'ta --
m262	NICK	No wonder you're such a chickenshit.  Now shut up.  There ain't no bat.
m262	EDDIE	My brother's a priest man.
m262	NICK	God!  How old are you?  There ain't no bat.
m262	EDDIE	There was no blood man.  My brother says... all the bad things you done... they come back and haunt you...
m262	NICK	No shit.  It was all over the pavement.
m262	EDDIE	Five stories straight down. There was no blood in the body.
m262	NICK	Gimme a break will you?  Shut up.
m262	EDDIE	That ain't what I heard.  That ain't what I heard at all.  I heard the bat got him.
m262	NICK	Look Johnny Gobs got ripped and walked off a roof all right?  No big loss.
m262	EDDIE	I dunno man.  After what happened to Johnny Gobs - -
m262	NICK	What are you scared of heights?
m262	EDDIE	Let's beat it man.  I don't like it up here.
m262	JACK	HA!  That's the best part. I CAN'T!!
m262	GRISSOM	Jack - - please - - WIPE THAT LUNATIC GRIN OFF YOUR FACE.
m262	JACK	JACK?  JACK?  DO I LOOK LIKE A JACK?
m262	GRISSOM	Jack listen -- we'll cut a deal --
m262	JACK	I've died once already.  It wasn't so bad -- In fact I recommend it.
m262	GRISSOM	It's not the girl Jack.  Sooner or later you would've tried to take me.  You may get me now but your life won't be worth a dime.
m262	JACK	"Is that what you """"heard""""?"
m262	GRISSOM	Jack?  Thank God.  I can't believe it's you.  I heard you'd been --
m262	JACK	"It's me.  """"Sugar Bumps."""""
m262	GRISSOM	Oh Jack.  -- Don't forget your lucky deck.
m262	JACK	I understand.
m262	GRISSOM	Because I want someone I can trust.
m262	JACK	Why do you need me to handle a simple break-in?
m262	GRISSOM	Very good idea Jack.  In fact --  -- I'd like you to handle this operation personally.
m262	JACK	"Okay a break-in.  Trash the office make off with the books ... """"Industrial espionage."""""
m262	JOKER	That's it.
m262	ROTELLI	That's it?
m262	JOKER	Nobody wants a war Carmine.  If we can't do business we shake hands and part friends.
m262	ROTELLI	And what happens if we say no?
m262	JOKER	I've considered that possibility.
m262	ROTELLI	I don't like taking orders from Grissom. And I especially don't like taking orders from Grissom's goon.
m262	JOKER	Goddammit I expect to be treated like and ARTIST. GET OFF MY SCREEN!!
m262	MAYOR	Please! We'll talk. Just tell us what you expect.
m262	JOKER	Ten million dollars. Ten mi -- YOU CHEAPSKATES! I've just wiped out the stock market. I've cost you billions!  I want ten million and one.
m262	MAYOR	All right then. Here's the deal. Total amnesty... and the sum of ten million dollars payable in --
m262	JOKER	Huh. Demands. Well gents this is kinda embarrassing but... I'm having such a swell time I just haven't thought any up.
m262	MAYOR	I'd like to read a prepared statement. 'While this administration remains vehemently opposed to terrorism in any form we are prepared to negotiate any reasonable demands which will guarantee the safety of the populace.'
m262	JOKER	Joker here. Can we talk?
m262	JOKER	Miss Vale was it something I said?  Do you want to sniff my flower?
m262	VICKI	I'll see you burn.  I'll see you dead -- GET AWAY FROM ME!!
m262	JOKER	What?  I improved her a little...
m262	VICKI	You SCUM!  You SICK FILTH!... You DID THAT to her!
m262	JOKER	Alicia!  Come here have a seat.  Show Miss Vale why you wear the mask.
m262	VICKI	... Why the mask?
m262	JOKER	Strong stomach huh?  I like that in a woman -- Maybe we can do business after all.
m262	VICKI	I've seen worse.  Much worse.
m262	JOKER	... Behind the makeup?
m262	VICKI	Maybe we should start with a portrait of the artist.  People might like to see the face behind the makeup.
m262	JOKER	A visual record yes.  A before-and- after kind of thing.  This could make your reputation.
m262	VICKI	And you want a --
m262	JOKER	Unfortunate but I think we can work around it.
m262	VICKI	... Thank you.
m262	KNOX	Holy shit. Holy...
m262	VICKI	God yes Allie. I've gotta say -- that was the ballsiest move I ever...
m262	KNOX	Yeah. Yeah. Little winded. DID YOU SEE THAT?!
m262	VICKI	You okay?
m262	KNOX	HOLY SHIT!!
m262	KNOX	Great. How??
m262	VICKI	LOOK! IT'S BRUCE!!  Allies -- the balloons. We've got to find some way to tell him!
m262	KNOX	What do you say? Let's head for the lights.
m262	VICKI	Yeah. Deja vu.
m262	KNOX	Couldn't turn down the job huh? A girl could get hurt this way.
m262	VICKI	It's gone.
m262	KNOX	Jesus Vicki! Where is it??
m262	VICKI	Allie... he wants to tell me. I had a roll of film. His face was on it. He knew that -- And he let me keep.
m262	KNOX	Vicki. We got a wealthy millionaire here... who dresses up like a bat. He goes out at night and swings around -- in his cape -- on a rope.  CRAZY BAT-STARD!
m262	VICKI	He's not crazy.
m262	KNOX	Not what?
m262	VICKI	Allie he's not.
m262	KNOX	The guy's bats all right. He's bat shit crazy. He --  -- I can't believe it. I was right!!
m262	KNOX	Bruce Wayne is out of his mind.  Next time you call him up and he can't go out Friday night - - think it over.
m262	VICKI	I've had it with you.  I'm leaving.
m262	KNOX	Right.  And they know him.  And that's why it would never occur to them for a minute that their old buddy Bruce puts on a cape at night and goes out looking for --
m262	VICKI	Alexander... I know you.
m262	KNOX	... Okay then I have a confession to make.  I'm the Batman.
m262	VICKI	He's best friends with Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent.  They would know.
m262	KNOX	... Oh?  Why is that Vicki?
m262	VICKI	Allie I know exactly why you're doing this.
m262	KNOX	Everybody needs a hobby.  You explain it Vicki.  He walks out on his own party.  Half an hour later who turns up?  Batman.  Sees an execution freaks out in an alleyway.  No place to change.
m262	VICKI	Are they paying you for all this?
m262	KNOX	Yeah?  According to this he's in Geneva from '76 to '79. Well I called Geneva.  Nobody there's even heard of the guy - - Probably off in Tibet with some kung fu master.
m262	VICKI	You are on drugs.
m262	KNOX	Something like this -- what do you suppose this could drive a guy to?
m262	VICKI	Oh Bruce...
m262	KNOX	Yep.  He watched the whole thing happen - - Recognize the beat cop?  Jim Gordon
m262	VICKI	His face.  Allie look at his face.
m262	KNOX	Nice snap huh?  Pulitzer Prize 1963.
m262	KNOX	Why?  Aw come on Vicki I'm a reporter. I'm curious.  I do this for a living.  There's a phone.  You can call him up and cancel.
m262	VICKI	Plain or roasted?  Alex I'm very flattered that you've gone out and done all this research.
m262	KNOX	Yeah.  Peanuts.  Which is how he goes through women.
m262	VICKI	Peanuts?
m262	KNOX	Bruce Wayne?  Date?  He called you up and asked you for a date?  Shit.  HEY MIRANDA!  C'MERE!  Now pay close attention to this.  Miranda -- tell my friend here what you told me about Bruce Wayne.
m262	VICKI	Guess who's got a date with Bruce Wayne?
m262	KNOX	Well he must like the way he looks.  He's got a mirror in every room.
m262	VICKI	Yum yum.
m262	KNOX	What were you thinking?
m262	VICKI	Oh.  Sorry.  I was thinking.
m262	KNOX	Well you know me.  The more they've got the less they're worth.  This guy must be the most worthless man in America.
m262	VICKI	That and the sweet smell of two hundred million bucks.
m262	KNOX	I bet they like him for his big charity balls.
m262	KNOX	Likes to kill? KNOX  Women find him magnetic.
m262	VICKI	Rich.  Reclusive.  Bankrolls half a dozen charities.
m262	KNOX	Holy shit...
m262	VICKI	All aver the world.  They say he's spent half of his life overseas.
m262	KNOX	Where does one man get all this junk?
m262	VICKI	Some.  I am a rich bitch remember?  I'm quoting.
m262	KNOX	Man I feel like Robin Leach.  You actually know all these people?
m262	KNOX	Well I'm starving.  Will you at least buy me a hamburger?
m262	VICKI	No.
m262	KNOX	Oh absolutely.  Bruce and I are very close.
m262	VICKI	Our next D.A. -- I hear Bruce Wayne is throwing a fundraiser.  Did you get your invitation yet?
m262	KNOX	Small so far.  I think he's leaving the big fish for Harvey Dent.
m262	VICKI	Evildoers huh?  Big or small?
m262	KNOX	Oh it's too good.  We got a six-foot bat that swoops out of the night and preys on evildoers.
m262	VICKI	A girl could get killed - - so they tell me.  What's new and hot in Gotham City?
m262	KNOX	God Vick a girl could get hurt doing this.
m262	KNOX	Too much glamor huh.  What's in the bag - - Monte Carlo?  Apes in Kenya?
m262	VICKI	Burned out.  I need a vacation.
m262	KNOX	Honey - - I would know any randomly selected square inch of Vicki Vale.  If I had a good enough hint.
m262	VICKI	How'd you know it was me?
m337	VADER	And code the signal to my private chamber.
m337	ADMIRAL	Yes My Lord.
m337	VADER	Move this ship out of the asteroid field and into a position where we can send a clear transmission.
m337	ADMIRAL	Yes he commands you make contact with him ....
m337	VADER	The Emperor?
m337	ADMIRAL	It was .... the Emperor ....
m337	ADMIRAL PIETT	Yes My Lord.  We'll find them.
m337	VADER	Alert all commands.  Calculate every possible destination along their last known trajectory and disburse the fleet to search for them.  Don't fail me again Admiral I've had quite enough!
m337	ADMIRAL PIETT	Lord Vader our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing.  The Millennium Falcon definitely went into lightspeed. It's probably on the other side of the galaxy by now.
m337	VADER	Yes Admiral .... soon.
m337	ADMIRAL PIETT	Soon Lord Vader.
m337	VADER	Asteroids don't concern me Admiral. I want that ship not excuses.  How long until you can have Skywalker and the others in the Millennium Falcon before me?
m337	ADMIRAL PIETT	Our pursuit ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon My Lord.  It has entered an asteroid field.
m337	VADER	Come in Admiral.
m337	ADMIRAL PIETT	My lord.
m337	YODA	No ... there is another.
m337	BEN	The boy is our last hope.
m337	YODA	Told you I did.  Reckless is he ... Now things are going to worse.
m337	YODA	Strong is Vader.  Clouded is your fate.  Mind what you have learned ... Notice everything everything!  It can save you.
m337	BEN	Luke use The Force only for knowledge and for defense not as a weapon.  Don't give in to hate or anger or fear ... they lead the way to the dark side ... Luke nods and climbs back into his ship.
m337	BEN	You are the last Jedi Luke.  You are our only hope.  Be patient.
m337	YODA	Stopped they must be.  Do you hear?  On this all depends.
m337	BEN	We've come this far ... He is our only hope.
m337	YODA	Will he finish what he begins?
m337	YODA	He's too old.  Yes.  Too old to start the training.
m337	BEN	He'll learn.
m337	YODA	This one I have watched a long time.  All his life has he looked away ... to the horizon to the sky to the future.  Never his mind on where he was on what he was doing.  Adventure excitement ...  A Jedi craves not these things!
m337	BEN	He can do it.
m337	BEN	We've discussed this before.
m337	YODA	Much anger in him like in his father.
m337	BEN	He will learn patience.
m337	BEN	Only a fully trained Jedi Knight with The Force as his ally will conquer Vader and his Emperor. If you end your training now if you choose the quick and easy path ... as Vader did ... you will become an agent of evil ... and the galaxy will be plunged deeper into the abyss of hate despair and pain that you feel your friends suffering now.
m337	LUKE	You won't.
m337	BEN	Luke I will not lose you to the Emperor as I lost Vader.
m337	LUKE	And that is why I must go.
m337	BEN	Will you?  You underestimate The Emperor.  It is you he wants ... that is why your friends suffer.
m337	BEN	But you cannot control it.  This is a dangerous time for you Luke. You are now most susceptible to the temptations of the dark side.
m337	LUKE	I feel The Force.
m337	BEN	You're not ready yet.  You still have much to learn.
m337	LUKE	I can help them!
m337	BEN	You don't know that.  Even I cannot see their fate.
m337	LUKE	But Han and Leia will surely die.
m337	BEN	... Luke you must not go.
m337	BEN	Luke ... you are the only hope.
m337	LUKE	Ben ... Ben ...
m337	BEN	You must go to the Dagobah System ... There you will learn from one who taught me:  Yoda the Jedi Master.
m337	LUKE	I'm cold ... so cold ...
m337	BEN	You must survive Luke.
m337	BEN	You must.  Luke look at me!
m337	LUKE	I can't ...
m337	LANDO	We're not out of this yet.
m337	CHEWIE	Howls.
m337	LANDO	Okay okay.
m337	CHEWIE	Turns on Lando the newcomer with an ominous growl.
m337	CHEWIE	Barks an argument and shakes his head.
m337	LANDO	Three patrol ships are heading our way.
m337	LANDO	What's wrong with him?
m337	CHEWIE	Barks a blue streak.
m337	LANDO	Everyone's invited of course.
m337	CHEWIE	Barks at the mention of food. Licks his lips.
m337	LANDO	Right.
m337	CHEWIE	Growls a reserved greeting.
m337	LANDO	How you doing Chewbacca?  Still wasting your time with this clown eh?
m337	HAN	I'm sure I'll see you again too. Keep well.  You'd better chain him until it's over.
m337	CHEWIE	Barks a doleful farewell.
m337	HAN	No I'm alright.  I'm alright.
m337	CHEWIE	Barks his concern.
m337	HAN	Not now Chewie.  Lando aren't you afraid the Empire might discover this little operation and shut you down?
m337	CHEWIE	Barks at Han.
m337	HAN	Why don't we just turn him over to Lando to fix?
m337	CHEWIE	Howls and shrugs his shoulders.
m337	HAN	That was a long time ago.  I'm sure he's forgotten all about it and so should you.
m337	CHEWIE	Barks and growls at his boss.
m337	HAN	Well it's been awhile.
m337	CHEWIE	Barks his agreement.
m337	LEIA	Okay Chewie it's now or never.
m337	LEIA	Chewie head for the bottom of the city.
m337	CHEWIE	Barks his consternation.
m337	CHEWIE	Howls.
m337	LEIA	... the power?
m337	CHEWIE	Barks his Ňright on!Ó
m337	LEIA	I don't care.  It would've been worth it .... for Han.
m337	CHEWIE	Barks his agreement.
m337	LEIA	We should have stayed and finished them off.
m337	LEIA	What happened?
m337	CHEWIE	Barks at his master.
m337	LUKE	How could you know my father? You don't even know who I am.  Can't we get on with this already?
m337	CREATURE	Oh your father ... a powerful Jedi was he powerful Jedi.
m337	LUKE	Because of my father I guess.
m337	CREATURE	Not far not far.  Be patient. Soon you will see him.  Why wish you become a Jedi?
m337	LUKE	Will it take long to get there? How far away is he?
m337	CREATURE	It's the Jedi's time to eat too.
m337	LUKE	Look it smells good.  I'm sure it's delicious   But I don't know why we can't see Yoda now.
m337	CREATURE	Patience.  It's time to eat.
m337	LUKE	... I told you I'm not hungry.
m337	CREATURE	Of course yes.  But now eat we must.  Good food I have good food.  Come come.
m337	LUKE	You know the Jedi Master?
m337	CREATURE	Oh a Jedi Master.  Different altogether.  Yoda you seek Yoda.
m337	LUKE	I'm not looking for a friend. I'm looking for a Jedi Master.
m337	CREATURE	No no!  I'll stay and help you find your friend.
m337	LUKE	Okay Artoo let him have it. Now get out of here little fellow we've got things to do.
m337	CREATURE	Mine mine.
m337	CREATURE	Mudhole?  Slimy?  My home this is.
m337	LUKE	I don't want your help.  I want my lamp back.  I'll need it in this slimy mudhole.
m337	CREATURE	Mine!  Mine!  Or I'll help you not.
m337	LUKE	Give me that!
m337	CREATURE	Can't get your ship out?  Have you tried?  Have you tried?
m337	LUKE	Listen friend we didn't mean to land here and if I could get my fighter out of this puddle I would but I can't.  So ...
m337	CREATURE	A great warrior?  Not many on those.  Wars don't make one great.
m337	LUKE	I'm looking for a great warrior.
m337	CREATURE	Help you I can ... yes ... yes.
m337	LUKE	Yeah ...
m337	CREATURE	Looking?  Looking?  You've found someone I'd say.  Heh?  Yes!
m337	LUKE	I'm looking for someone.
m337	CREATURE	Away put your weapon.  I mean you no harm.
m337	LUKE	... Like we're being watched.
m337	HAN	Then I'll see you in Hell.
m337	DECK SERGEANT	The night storms will start before you can reach the first marker.
m337	HAN	You bet it is ... and Luke's out in it.
m337	DECK SERGEANT	The temperature is dropping too fast.
m337	HAN	We'll have to go out on Tauntauns.
m337	DECK SERGEANT	We haven't got them adapted to this cold yet ...
m337	HAN	Not likely!  Where are the speeders?
m337	DECK SERGEANT	Commander Skywalker hasn't come through the south entrance sir. Maybe he slipped by without checking in.
m337	HAN	Probably isn't good enough Sergeant. Check on it!
m337	DECK SERGEANT	I haven't seen him.  He probably came in through the south entrance.
m337	HAN	Sergeant is Commander Skywalker back yet?
m337	DECK SERGEANT	Yes sir!
m337	VADER	He will join us or die My Master.
m337	EMPEROR	Yes ... yes.  That would be a great asset.
m337	VADER	But if he could be turned he would be a powerful ally.
m337	EMPEROR	You are weak!  I have seen it. The Force is strong with him. He must be destroyed.
m337	VADER	He's not a Jedi he's just a boy. Obi-wan could not have taught him so much that ...
m337	EMPEROR	The son of Skywalker.  You must destroy him ... or he will be our undoing.
m337	VADER	Our destruction?  Who?
m337	EMPEROR	Our situation is most precarious. We have a new enemy who could bring about our destruction.
m337	VADER	I have felt it.
m337	EMPEROR	There is a grave disturbance in The Force.
m337	VADER	What is thy bidding My Master?
m337	HAN	Fine.  But they'll have to take care of themselves.
m337	RIEEKAN	Wait.  I'll send a patrol with you.
m337	HAN	Whatever it is it isn't friendly. I'm going to have a look.  Come on Chewie.
m337	RIEEKAN	I understand.  A death mark is not an easy thing to live with ... Until our paths cross again may the force be with you.
m337	HAN	Thank you General.  But there's a price on my head.  If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt I'm a walking dead man.
m337	RIEEKAN	You're an extraordinary fighter. I hate to lose you.
m337	HAN	That's right.
m337	HAN	The Empire won't look for you out here.  I'd say you're all set ... which means it's time for me to get going.
m337	RIEEKAN	With all the meteor activity in this system it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.
m337	HAN	He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. He'll be in soon.
m337	RIEEKAN	Good and Commander Skywalker?
m337	HAN	There isn't a hint of life in the area.  But all the perimeter markers are set so you'll know if anyone comes calling.
m337	RIEEKAN	Captain Solo.  What's the situation?
m337	HAN	Good.  Soon as we're clear we'll kick this baby into hyperdrive.
m337	THREEPIO	I can see the edge of the asteroid field sir.
m337	HAN	Not collapsing honey.  It's closing!  This is no cave ...
m337	THREEPIO	We're doomed.  Goodbye Mistress Leia.  Goodbye Captain ...
m337	HAN	I'm going to see what it is.
m337	THREEPIO	It sounds like it's trying to get in.
m337	THREEPIO	I must admit there are times I don't understand human behavior.
m337	HAN	You too golden rod.
m337	THREEPIO	Sir I'm almost afraid to ask but does shutting down all but emergency power systems include me?
m337	HAN	What are you so grouchy about?
m337	HAN	We're in trouble!
m337	THREEPIO	If I may say so Sir I noticed earlier that the entire main para- light system seems to be damaged.
m337	HAN	I think we're in trouble.
m337	THREEPIO	It can wait.
m337	HAN	Sit down and shut up!
m337	THREEPIO	Sir I was wondering ...
m337	THREEPIO	The energy shield is down.  We'll be stuck here forever.
m337	HAN	Transport XJ. get out of here. Go!
m337	HAN	The kid ran into something mean and it wasn't the cold.
m337	THREEPIO	I do hope he's all there ... if you take my meaning.  I would hate to see Master Luke develop a short circuit ...
m337	HAN	He doesn't make sense to me either Chewie.
m337	HAN	Go tell your precious Princess ... Luke is dead unless he shows up soon.
m337	THREEPIO	I don't know Artoo.  Sir might I inquire what's going on?
m337	THREEPIO	She is looking for Master Luke and assumed he would be here with you.  No one seems to know ...
m337	HAN	I shut it off.  What's her royal holiness want?
m337	THREEPIO	Mistress Leia has been trying to reach you on the communicator but either you have it turned off or it is malfunctioning ... if it's damaged Artoo could fix it if you like.
m337	HAN	What is it?
m337	THREEPIO	Captain Solo sir. Might I have a word with you?
m337	HAN	... just remember that Ôcause I'll be back ...
m337	LEIA	... I love you.  I couldn't tell you before but it's true.
m337	HAN	Me either.  They had me howling on the scan grid but they never asked me any questions.
m337	LEIA	I'm worried about all of us.  I can't figure out what they're up to.
m337	HAN	I was worried about you.
m337	HAN	Look sweetheart I'm not going to have you accusing my friend of ...
m337	LEIA	No thanks.
m337	LEIA	Chewie do you think you can repair him?
m337	HAN	Well I do trust him.  Lando's an old friend.  Must have been an accident.
m337	LEIA	Something's wrong here.  Your friend Lando is very charming but I don't trust him.
m337	HAN	He found him in a junk pile ...
m337	HAN	Luke!  I'm sure he's fine.  Probably sitting around wondering what we're doing right now.
m337	LEIA	I hope Luke made it to the fleet all right.
m337	HAN	Huh?  Oh.  Your droid's been gone too long just to be lost.  He may have gotten into some trouble. Chewie went to look for him.  Come over here.  I want to check this out.
m337	LEIA	Has Threepio turned up yet?
m337	HAN	You look great.
m337	LEIA	You look silly.
m337	HAN	Who's staring?
m337	LEIA	What are you staring at?
m337	HAN	It'll be all right.  Trust me.  And keep your eyes open.  You wait here.
m337	LEIA	I don't like this.
m337	HAN	Let Ôer go Chewie.
m337	LEIA	You do have your moments ... Not many but you do have them.
m337	HAN	No.  But he has no love for the Empire that much I know ...
m337	LEIA	Can you trust him?
m337	HAN	A Tibanna gas mine.  Lando won it in a sabacc match or so he claims. Lando and I go way back.
m337	LEIA	A mining colony.
m337	HAN	Lando's not a system he's a man. A gambler con-artist ... all- around scoundrel ...  ... your kind of guy.  The system is called Bespin.  It's a ways from here but reachable.
m337	LEIA	Never heard of that system.
m337	HAN	Well sometimes ... Ah-hah I knew it!  Lando Calrissian.
m337	LEIA	You keep logs?  My how organized.
m337	HAN	Funny I have the feeling I've been in this area before.  Let me check my logs.
m337	HAN	Here ... near the Anoat system.
m337	LEIA	That depends.  Where are we?
m337	HAN	Then we have to find a safe port around here.  Got any ideas?
m337	LEIA	Not bad hot shot not bad.  Then what?
m337	HAN	The fleet is finally breaking up. I'm hoping they'll follow standard Imperial procedure and dump their garbage before they go into light speed.
m337	LEIA	What'd you have in mind for your next move?
m337	HAN	Chewie check the manual release on the landing claws.
m337	LEIA	I'm still not sure what you've accomplished.
m337	HAN	Oh so sorry!  Didn't mean to offend your droid.  You think braking and shutting down in that amount of time is easy?
m337	LEIA	You could have warned him before you shut him off.
m337	LEIA	You're going to attack them?!!!
m337	HAN	Sharp bank Chewie.  Let's turn this bucket around.  You heard me turn around!  Full power on the front shield.
m337	HAN	It's not my fault.  I can't under- stand it!
m337	LEIA	No lightspeed?
m337	HAN	Couldn't be I checked the transfer circuits just like you said!  I tell you this time it's not my fault.  I'm sure I checked it.
m337	LEIA	The entrance is collapsing!
m337	HAN	I see it Chewie hang on.
m337	LEIA	But the tremors have stopped.
m337	HAN	Strap yourself in sweetheart we're taking off!
m337	LEIA	Those Star Destroyers will spot us long before you can get into light speed.  You can't make the jump in this asteroid field.
m337	HAN	There will be more of them.  They always travel in groups.  And there's nothing they like better than to attach themselves to ships. Just what we need right now.
m337	LEIA	Looks like some kind of Mynock.
m337	HAN	Look we just got this bucket going again.  I'm not about to let some varmint tear it apart ...
m337	LEIA	Are you crazy!
m337	LEIA	Outside in the cave.
m337	HAN	Where?
m337	LEIA	There's something out there!
m337	HAN	Try and control this ...
m337	LEIA	I do not!
m337	HAN	You mean a man you can control.
m337	LEIA	There's nothing dull about a man I can depend on to be civilized.
m337	HAN	Sure they're safer.  You always know what they're going to do. Trouble is it gets a little dull.
m337	LEIA	Don't count on it.  I happen to like nice men.
m337	LEIA	Afraid of?  Certainly not you Captain Solo ... or any other man in this galaxy.
m337	HAN	What are you afraid of?
m337	HAN	Why?
m337	LEIA	Stop that.
m337	HAN	That's quite a compliment.
m337	LEIA	Sometimes maybe ... occasionally when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.
m337	HAN	You could be a touch warmer though.  Admit it against your better judgment you think I'm all right.
m337	LEIA	Yes you do.
m337	HAN	Sure.  I guess I make it difficult sometimes.
m337	LEIA	Would you please stop calling me that?
m337	HAN	Easy your worship.  Only trying to help.
m337	LEIA	Where have I heard that before?
m337	HAN	They're just trying to see if they can stir something up ... we're safe.
m337	LEIA	They're moving away.
m337	LEIA	Felt like a hydro concussion ... an Imperial Cruiser.
m337	HAN	That was no earthquake.
m337	HAN	Fine with me.  But I'm afraid you'll have to let go.
m337	LEIA	I don't expect anything except to be left alone.
m337	HAN	Well I hope you don't expect more.
m337	LEIA	Sorry Captain being held by you isn't enough to get me excited.
m337	HAN	Beautiful.
m337	LEIA	How do I look?
m337	HAN	You don't look angry.
m337	LEIA	Very funny.  You can let go now .... I'm getting angry.
m337	HAN	Why Princess this is so sudden.
m337	HAN	That should do nicely.
m337	LEIA	What is it?
m337	HAN	There there.  Chewie get a reading on that.  Looks pretty good.
m337	HAN	Right.  I'm going to get in closer to one of these big ones ...
m337	LEIA	Now you're making sense.
m337	HAN	We've got to get out of this shower.
m337	LEIA	I'm against that.
m337	HAN	But we're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer.
m337	LEIA	Good.
m337	HAN	That Star Destroyer is slowing down.
m337	LEIA	I take it back.
m337	HAN	Well you said you wanted to be there when I was wrong.
m337	HAN	Aren't I?  Hang on sweetheart. We're gonna do some flyin'.
m337	LEIA	To get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field?
m337	HAN	Let's hope so ... it's just the chance we need.
m337	LEIA	Probably an asteroid field ....
m337	HAN	Asteroids!  Chewie bank left let's find out where they're coming from ...
m337	LEIA	Or you ran into something ....
m337	HAN	That was no laser blast .... some- thing hit us ....
m337	LEIA	I'm glad you said there was going to be no problem or I'd be worried.
m337	HAN	Two more Star Destroyers heading right at us.
m337	HAN	I know I know I see them ... LEIA See what?
m337	LEIA	I'll be surprised if we ever start moving.
m337	HAN	This baby's got a few surprises left in her.
m337	LEIA	This bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade.
m337	HAN	Don't worry your holiness I'll get her started.
m337	LEIA	Would it help if I got out and pushed?
m337	LEIA	Wait don't open it ... that's one of the traps for the ice creatures.
m337	HAN	Hey!  Someone's still in here.
m337	HAN	Who's scruffy-looking?  I tell ya' sweetheart I must've hit pretty close to the mark to get you hoppin' like this.  Doesn't it look that way to you Luke?
m337	LEIA	Why you low-down stuck-up half- witted scruffy-looking nerf-herder.
m337	HAN	Come on your highness are you telling me you haven't been thinking about that kiss?
m337	LEIA	You must have gone completely out of your feeble mind.
m337	HAN	Ooops!  I guess you haven't told Luke about that yet.
m337	LEIA	I don't know what he's talking about.
m337	LEIA	I had nothing to do with it.  General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we know where that probe came from.
m337	HAN	Well your worship it looks like you arranged to keep me close by for a while longer.
m337	HAN	Now don't panic.  We don't know that.
m337	LEIA	An Imperial probe droid.
m337	HAN	Droid of some kind.  I didn't hit it that hard.  It must have had a self-destruct ....
m337	LEIA	What was it?
m337	HAN	.... I'm afraid there's not much left.
m337	HAN	No kidding.  If this snowball's got nasty natives they could be anywhere.
m337	LEIA	Now all we've got to worry about is what attacked him.
m337	HAN	Forget it.
m337	LEIA	Those creatures he keeps talking about ... we'd better double the security ... Han I don't know how ...
m337	HAN	Sure ... If I were interested. But I don't think it'd be much fun.
m337	LEIA	And you think you're the one to apply some heat?
m337	HAN	Spare me please!  Don't tell me about the Rebellion again.  I've had it with your noble mission. All you let yourself think about is the Rebellion.  The result is you're as cold as this planet.
m337	LEIA	We are fighting for a cause much ...
m337	HAN	There's no accounting for taste. Believe me you could use a good kiss.  You've spent so much time doing your duty and giving orders you've never learned how to be a woman. It's a shame because you've got all the makings for one.  I could have helped you plenty in that department ... if you'd have let go for a minute.  But it's too late now sweetheart.  Your big opportunity is flying out of here.
m337	LEIA	I'd just as soon kiss a wookiee.
m337	HAN	Am I?  I say you came running after me because you were afraid I was leaving you without even a kiss.
m337	LEIA	I respect you.  You're a bold fighter maybe not the brightest but ... HAN No your worship.. That's not what I'm talking about.
m337	HAN	You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.
m337	LEIA	And what are they pray tell?
m337	HAN	You probably don't.  How could you?  You're so terrified of your own emotions ...
m337	LEIA	Me?  I don't know what you mean.
m337	HAN	Not you?
m337	LEIA	Yes.
m337	HAN	We?
m337	LEIA	Han we need you here.
m337	HAN	He'll know when he gets back ... Don't give me that look.  Every day more bounty hunters are searching for me.  If I don't pay off Jabba soon there'll be too many to stop ... Remotes Gank killers and who knows what else.  I've got to get that price off my head while I still have a head.
m337	LEIA	Does Luke know?
m337	HAN	That bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind.
m337	LEIA	You said you were going to stay. What happened?
m337	HAN	Yes Your Highness?
m337	HAN	Don't worry.  You haven't seen the last of us.
m337	LUKE	I hope you make your peace with Jabba.
m337	HAN	Now don't get the wrong idea pal. She was just trying to express her true feelings for me.
m337	LUKE	About what?
m337	HAN	That makes a good story.  But I think you just can't bear to let me out of your sight.
m337	LUKE	Probe?  What probe?
m337	HAN	That's two you owe me junior.
m337	LUKE	Thanks to you.
m337	HAN	Hi kid you look strong enough to wrestle a Gundark.
m337	LUKE	I'll see you shortly. A meteorite just hit the ground near here and I want to check it out .. Won't be long.
m337	HAN	There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. My sentry markers are placed. I'm heading back to the base.
m337	LUKE	I've finished my circle and I haven't picked up any life read- ings.
m337	HAN	Loud and clear kid.  What's up?
m337	HAN	Yeah you're a real hero.
m337	LANDO	Don't shoot!  I've done what I can for you.  I'm sorry it's not better but I've got my own problems.  I've already stuck my neck out further than I should ...
m337	LANDO	Don't ask me but he's on his way.
m337	HAN	All this just to get the kid? What's so important about him?
m337	HAN	Luke?  I don't get it.
m337	LANDO	He doesn't want you at all.  He's after someone named Skywalker.
m337	HAN	You don't know much about much if you think Vader won't want us dead before this is over.
m337	LANDO	Vader agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.  They'll have to stay here but at least they'll be safe.
m337	HAN	This ought to be good.
m337	LANDO	Shut up a minute and listen.  I'm doing what I can to make this easier for you.
m337	HAN	Get out of here Lando!
m337	HAN	I'm sorry too.
m337	LANDO	Sorry friend I had no choice. They arrived right before you did.
m337	HAN	Nothing.  I never would have guessed that underneath that wild schemer I knew was a respon- sible leader and businessman ... But you wear it well.
m337	LANDO	Not as well as I'd like.  We're a small outpost and not very self- sufficient.  I've had supply problems of every kind and ...  What's so funny?
m337	HAN	How's your mining operation going?
m337	LANDO	I'll have my people get to work on it right away.  Hate the thought of the Millennium Falcon without her heart.
m337	HAN	Hyperdrive.
m337	LANDO	That ship saved my life a few times.  It's the fastest hunk of machinery in the galaxy.  What's wrong with her?
m337	LANDO	What have you done to my ship?
m337	HAN	Repairs ...
m337	LANDO	That won't be easy my friend ... What brings you here anyway?
m337	LANDO	I'll bet.
m337	HAN	I always said you were a gentleman.
m337	LANDO	Are you kidding?
m337	HAN	No hard feelings?
m337	LANDO	Why you slimy double-crossing no-good swindler ... am I glad to see you.
m337	VADER	I'm altering the bargain.  Pray I don't alter it any further.
m337	LANDO	That wasn't the bargain.  You said the Empire wouldn't interfere in--
m337	VADER	Take them but I'm keeping a detachment of troops here to watch over them.
m337	LANDO	I'll take what's mine now.
m337	VADER	I think not.  But I don't wish my prize to be damaged.  We'll test it first.  Bring in Captain Solo.
m337	LANDO	We only use this chamber for carbon freezing.  If you put him in there it'll kill him.
m337	VADER	Good.  It would be most unfortunate if I had to leave a permanent garrison here.
m337	LANDO	No.
m337	VADER	I forget nothing Calrissian. Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.
m337	LANDO	That was never mentioned.  Neither was this bounty hunter taking Han. I hope you haven't forgotten our bargain.
m337	VADER	You will find them well enough. But they must never again leave this city.
m337	LANDO	What about Leia and the Wookiee?
m337	LEIA	That sounds familiar.
m337	LANDO	I'm sure my men fixed it.  We've got nothing to worry about.
m337	LEIA	Are the coordinates set?
m337	LANDO	The deflector shields are gone.
m337	LEIA	It's Luke.  Get under him.  Slow down.  Easy Chewie.  Line up your tracking system.  Lando open the hatch.
m337	LANDO	Someone's falling.
m337	LANDO	Wait a minute.  We're not going back there.
m337	LEIA	No argument just do it.  That's a command!
m337	LEIA	Luke needs help.  We must go back.
m337	LANDO	What?
m337	LEIA	Luke!
m337	LANDO	I knew that set-up was too good to last .... I'm going to miss it.
m337	LANDO	I didn't say anything?
m337	LEIA	What'd you say?
m337	LANDO	His fate is sealed.  You'll be lucky to get out yourself.  All systems are on alert.  everything's locked.
m337	LEIA	We've got to find Luke.
m337	LANDO	Don't worry about a thing.  I'll get us going.
m337	LEIA	You'd better know what you're doing or this is going to get very messy.
m337	LEIA	What chance have we got in here? What are we going to do when they cut ...
m337	LANDO	Sure I did ... once.  It turned out lousy.
m337	LEIA	You've probably never done an honorable thing in your life.
m337	LANDO	Very noble.  Not smart but noble.
m337	LANDO	There's not much chance but the bounty hunter's ship is on the East Landing Platform.
m337	LEIA	Chewie's right.  We must try to save Han.
m337	LANDO	This is no time to be choosy honey.  What do you say we debate this later?  There's still a chance I can get you out of here.
m337	LEIA	We have no use for your kind.
m337	LANDO	Look I stand to lose everything by this.
m337	LEIA	And when do you betray us again?
m337	LANDO	I'm coming over to your side that's what.  And I have a feeling I'm making a big mistake.
m337	LEIA	What's going on?
m337	LEIA	... we're the bait.
m337	LANDO	Lord Vader has set a trap for him and ...
m337	LANDO	I didn't know you had a price on your head.  Vader has given you to the bounty hunter.
m337	LEIA	What about Han?
m337	LANDO	Yes we keep pollution down by having the power reactor far below the city.  It's connected by a transfer shaft.
m337	LEIA	It's a lovely outpost.
m337	LANDO	Not actually .... Our operation is small enough not to be noticed so you might say we're enterprisers. Most of our trade is well ... unofficial.
m337	LEIA	You're part of the mining guild then?
m337	LANDO	.... We are a free station and do not fall under the jurisdiction of the Empire.
m337	LANDO	Would you care to join me for a little refreshment?
m337	LEIA	Thanks.
m337	LANDO	I must say your beauty is unpar- alleled.  Truly you belong here with us among the clouds.
m337	LEIA	Not really.
m337	LANDO	Sorry am I interrupting anything?
m337	LEIA	You may call me Leia.
m337	LANDO	Hello!  What have we here?  Welcome I am Baron Lando Calrissian Administrator of this facility ... and who might you be?
m337	RIEEKAN	We have no choice.  Send them up ... and start clearing everyone out.
m337	LEIA	Two transports at a time is awfully risky.
m337	LEIA	What is it?
m337	RIEEKAN	We've picked up something outside the base in zone one moving East.
m337	RIEEKAN	Not yet.  They're working on it now.
m337	LEIA	Have they analyzed the one that was killed?
m337	RIEEKAN	Slim but yes there's a chance. They have a shelter.  It's not much but ...
m337	LEIA	Is there any chance of them surviving out there?
m337	RIEEKAN	The speeders should be ready in the morning.  They'll make the search easier.
m337	LEIA	I understand.
m337	RIEEKAN	Nothing more can be done tonight. The shield doors must be closed. I can't wait any longer.  I'm sorry.
m337	LEIA	Let's go.
m337	THREEPIO	Artoo you did it!  I never doubted you for a second ...
m337	LEIA	I thought you knew this person.
m337	THREEPIO	Rather touchy aren't they.
m337	LEIA	Well what now?
m337	THREEPIO	Sir we've lost the rear deflector shield.  One more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for.
m337	THREEPIO	Oh my no!
m337	LEIA	What??
m337	THREEPIO	Sir it's very possible this asteroid is not stable.
m337	LEIA	A tremor!
m337	LEIA	Closer?!
m337	THREEPIO	Closer?!
m337	THREEPIO	If I might remind you sir the probability of successfully navi- gating through an asteroid field is approximately 365000 to one ... a graceful surrender might not be ...
m337	LEIA	You don't have to do this to impress me.
m337	LEIA	I'll be back later.
m337	THREEPIO	So much has happened during the period of your indisposition sir.
m337	LEIA	You rest now.
m337	LUKE	I've never seen it fail.
m337	LEIA	This hyperdrive had better work.
m337	LUKE	He'll survive.
m337	LEIA	Lando is he alright? ... Lando? Are you there?  How's Luke?
m337	LEIA	Luke no!  It's a trap.
m337	LUKE	Leia!
m337	LUKE	Snow creatures ... they're here?!
m337	LEIA	I could get more loyalty if I went down the hall and recruited some of those snow creatures.
m337	LUKE	Jabba the Hutt?
m337	LEIA	He wants to pay off that criminal he's in hock to.
m337	LUKE	Calm down will ya?  Tell me about Han.
m337	LUKE	Han's leaving?
m337	LEIA	First Han now you.  When am I going to learn not to count on anyone but myself? ...
m337	LUKE	What are you talking about?
m337	LEIA	That's just great.  Why doesn't everyone just take off?
m337	LUKE	I have this ... feeling.  I'm not sure really ...
m337	LEIA	Where are you going?
m337	LEIA	What did you say?!
m337	LUKE	Leia ... What would you think if I went away for a while?
m337	LEIA	Me too.  I was afraid.
m337	LUKE	I'm fine.  Really.  Leia ... when I was out there and it looked pretty bad ... well it made me think about things.
m337	LEIA	The Bacta are growing well.  The scars should be gone in a day or so.  Does it still hurt?
m337	YODA	If it must be.  Yes.
m337	LUKE	And sacrifice Han and Leia?
m337	LUKE	I've learned so much since then.  And I'll return to finish ... I promise that master.
m337	YODA	Yes yes.  To Obi-wan you listen young one.  The tree.  Remember your failure at the tree!  Heh?
m337	YODA	Foreknowledge is helpful but painful sometimes and dangerous too.  You have far to go in your training.
m337	LUKE	They're my friends.
m337	YODA	Difficult to see.  Always in motion is the future ... Back away little machine!
m337	LUKE	Will they die?
m337	YODA	It is the future you see.
m337	LUKE	I see them! ... They're in pain ... they're suffering.
m337	YODA	Bespin.  I see it too ... Friends you have there heh?  Concentrate and see them you will.
m337	LUKE	I see a city in the clouds.
m337	YODA	Control control you must learn of what you see.  Not easy not fast.
m337	LUKE	My mind fills with so many images.
m337	YODA	Free your mind and return he will.
m337	LUKE	Ben?  Ben?
m337	YODA	Only what you take with you.
m337	LUKE	What's in there?
m337	YODA	This tree is strong with the dark side of The Force.  A servant of evil it is.  Into it you must go.
m337	LUKE	I feel cold.
m337	LUKE	Yes ... I also feel danger ... death.  Something's not right.
m337	YODA	Four this time!  The Force you feel.
m337	YODA	No!  Nothing more will I tell you now. Clear your mind of questions ... Quiet now be ... at peace ...
m337	LUKE	But tell me why ...
m337	YODA	You will know.  When you are at peace ... calm ... passive.  A Jedi uses The Force for knowledge and defense.  Never for attack.
m337	LUKE	But how am I to know the good side from the dark?
m337	YODA	No no.  Easier quicker more seductive.
m337	LUKE	Lord Vader ... Is the dark side stronger?
m337	YODA	The dark side beckons.  But if once start down the dark path forever will it dominate your destiny.  Consume you it will ... as it did Obi-wan's apprentice.
m337	LUKE	Price?  What do you mean?
m337	YODA	Anger fear aggression!  The dark side of The Force are they.  Easily they flow ... quick to join you in a fight.  Beware beware beware of them.  A heavy price is paid for the power they bring.
m337	LUKE	But I feel The Force flowing!
m337	YODA	No no.  This will not do.  Anger is what you feel.
m337	YODA	That would matter not were The Force flowing through you.  Higher you'd jump!  Faster you'd move! Open yourself to The Force you must.
m337	LUKE	They're a lot stronger than I'm used to.
m337	YODA	That they are.
m337	LUKE	I thought those seekers were set for stun!
m337	YODA	Concentration.  Heh?  Concentration.
m337	YODA	That is why you fail.
m337	LUKE	I don't believe it.
m337	YODA	Size has no meaning.  It matters not.  Look at me.  Judge me by my size do you?
m337	LUKE	I can't. It's too big.
m337	YODA	No.  Try not.  Do do.  Or do not. There is no try.
m337	LUKE	Okay.  I'll give it a try.
m337	YODA	No!  No different!  The differences are in your mind.  Throw them out! No longer of use are they to you.
m337	LUKE	Master moving rocks is one thing but this is a little different.
m337	YODA	Yes but by what standard ask I?  Forget your old measures. Unlearn heh unlearn.
m337	LUKE	I thought I was in good shape.
m337	YODA	It would be in seven pieces were you a Jedi.
m337	YODA	You will be my young one.  Heh. You will be.
m337	LUKE	I will not fail you.  I'm not afraid.
m337	YODA	You are reckless!
m337	LUKE	I have followed my feelings.
m337	YODA	To become a Jedi takes the deepest commitment the most serious mind.
m337	LUKE	Why not me?
m337	YODA	Ready are you?  What know you of ready?  I have trained Jedi for 800 years.  My own counsel I'll keep on who is to be trained.
m337	LUKE	Never.
m337	VADER	There is no escape.  You must join me or die.  Don't make me destroy you here ... The Emperor is strong with The Force.  But if you join me together we could overthrow Him.  Do not resist. It is our destiny!
m337	LUKE	No! .... Never ....
m337	VADER	The Force runs strong in the Skywalker line.  You will achieve great power ... Come join with me!  Together we will be the most powerful ... even stronger than The Emperor.
m337	LUKE	Time will tell.
m337	VADER	All too easy.  Perhaps you are not as strong as The Emperor thought.
m337	VADER	That won't be necessary.
m337	LUKE	I'll die first.
m337	VADER	There is much Obi-wan did not tell you.  Come The Emperor will complete your training.
m337	LUKE	No!
m337	VADER	Your future lies with us Skywalker. Now you will embrace the dark side. Obi-wan knew this to be true.
m337	VADER	And I too.
m337	LUKE	You'll find I'm full of surprises.
m337	VADER	The fear does not reach you.  You have learned more than I anticipated.
m337	VADER	I want that ship.
m337	PIETT	It won't get through the blockade.
m337	VADER	Anything on the Millennium Falcon?
m337	PIETT	Seventeen ships destroyed we don't know how many got away.
m337	VADER	Make ready to land General Veers' assault troops on the surface. Then deploy the fleet so that nothing can get off that system. You're in command now Admiral Piett.
m337	PIETT	Yes My Lord.
m337	PIETT	Yes Sir .... we have visuals ... the System is supposed to be devoid of human forms ...
m337	VADER	The Hoth System?
m489	LANDO	We're on our way. Red Group Gold Group all fighters follow me.  Told you they'd do it!
m489	ACKBAR	The shield is down! Commence attack on theDeath Star's main reactor.
m489	LANDO	We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might just take a few of them with us.
m489	ACKBAR	At that close range we won't last long against those Star Destroyers.
m489	LANDO	Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time.
m489	ACKBAR	We have no choice General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude.
m489	LANDO	You won't get another chance at this Admiral.
m489	ACKBAR	We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.
m489	LANDO	All right. Stand by.
m489	ACKBAR	All craft prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark.
m489	ACKBAR	Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates.
m489	LANDO	Admiral we're in position. All fighters accounted for.
m489	BEN	She hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have Luke... but the Force is strong with her as it is with all of your family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy Vader!
m489	LUKE	But you can't let her get involved now Ben. Vader will destroy her.
m489	BEN	Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down Luke. They do you credit. But they could be made to serve the Emperor.
m489	LUKE	Leia! Leia's my sister.
m489	BEN	Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew as I did if Anakin were to have any offspring they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.
m489	LUKE	But I have no sister.
m489	BEN	The other he spoke of is your twin sister.
m489	LUKE	Yoda spoke of another.
m489	BEN	Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.
m489	LUKE	I can't kill my own father.
m489	BEN	To be a Jedi Luke you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you like your father. Only your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door and you have held firm. You're no longer so reckless now Luke. You are strong and patient. And now you must face Darth Vader again!
m489	LUKE	But I had to help my friends.
m489	BEN	Vader humbled you when first you met him Luke... but that experience was part of your training. It taught you among other things the value of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared.
m489	LUKE	I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.
m489	BEN	You cannot escape your destiny.
m489	LUKE	I can't do it Ben.
m489	BEN	I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.
m489	LUKE	There's still good in him.
m489	BEN	You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view.
m489	LUKE	You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.
m489	BEN	Yoda will always be with you.
m489	LUKE	I can't do it Artoo. I can't go on alone.
m489	HAN	Who are you?
m489	BOUSHH	Jabba's palace.
m489	HAN	Where am I?
m489	BOUSHH	Your eyesight will return in time.
m489	HAN	I can't see.
m489	BOUSHH	Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.
m489	VADER	His lightsaber.
m489	EMPEROR	Oh no my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things.
m489	EMPEROR	Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them.
m489	VADER	They are clear my Master.
m489	EMPEROR	Strange that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear Lord Vader.
m489	VADER	I have felt him my Master.
m489	VADER	A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor.
m489	EMPEROR	I told you to remain on the command ship.
m489	VADER	Yes my Master.
m489	EMPEROR	It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders.
m489	VADER	What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?
m489	EMPEROR	Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for.
m489	VADER	What is thy bidding my Master?
m489	EMPEROR	Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.
m489	VADER	As you wish.
m489	EMPEROR	Patience my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.
m489	VADER	Yes my Master.
m489	EMPEROR	You have done well Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.
m489	VADER	The Death Star will be completed on schedule.
m489	LUKE	Threepio tell them if they don't do as you wish you'll become angry and use your magic.
m489	HAN	Somehow I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
m489	LUKE	Han don't. It'll be all right.
m489	HAN	Hey!
m489	HAN	Yeah sure.
m489	LUKE	Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing.  Han can you reach my lightsaber?
m489	HAN	Nice work. Great Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach.
m489	LUKE	Come on Artoo.  We'll need your scanners.
m489	HAN	Take the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.
m489	LUKE	We got separated.
m489	HAN	I thought she was with you.
m489	LUKE	Quietly there might be more of them out there.
m489	HAN	Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.
m489	HAN	It's your imagination kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here.
m489	LUKE	I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.
m489	HAN	I don't know.  Fly casual.
m489	HAN	Now don't get jittery Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though Chewie but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance.
m489	LUKE	Vader's on that ship.
m489	LUKE	All set.
m489	HAN	Right. Chewie let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready everybody?
m489	LUKE	Yeah she's comin' up.
m489	HAN	You got her warmed?
m489	LUKE	Hi Han... Chewie.
m489	HAN	Luke.
m489	LUKE	I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.
m489	HAN	Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?
m489	HAN	Oh... great!
m489	LUKE	Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.
m489	HAN	You're gonna die here you know. Convenient.
m489	LUKE	There's nothing to see. I used to live here you know.
m489	HAN	I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur I see a big light blur.
m489	HAN	That bad huh? Where's Leia?
m489	LUKE	The same as always.
m489	HAN	How are we doing?
m489	LUKE	Wouldn't miss it.
m489	HAN	Fine. Together again huh?
m489	LUKE	Are you all right?
m489	HAN	Luke!
m489	LUKE	Han!
m489	HAN	All right. I understand. Fine. When he comes back I won't get in the way.
m489	LEIA	Yes.
m489	HAN	You love him don't you?
m489	LEIA	He wasn't. I can feel it.
m489	HAN	I'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing when it blew.
m489	HAN	Here's the terminal.
m489	LEIA	The code's changed. We need Artoo!
m489	HAN	Charges!  Come on come on!
m489	LEIA	Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.
m489	HAN	Hey don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
m489	LEIA	The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. This isn't gonna be easy.
m489	LEIA	Hold me.
m489	HAN	I'm sorry.
m489	HAN	Ahhh...
m489	LEIA	I...
m489	LEIA	I don't know.
m489	HAN	What's going on?
m489	HAN	It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.
m489	LEIA	Shall we try and go around?
m489	HAN	It'll work. It'll work.
m489	LEIA	Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.
m489	HAN	Yeah I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again.
m489	LEIA	Hey are you awake?
m489	LEIA	That's all any of us can see.
m489	HAN	I don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand!
m489	LEIA	I gotta get you out of here.
m489	HAN	Leia!
m489	LEIA	Someone who loves you.
m489	HAN	You too.
m489	LANDO	Good luck.
m489	LANDO	All right old buddy. You know I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her. She-she won't get a scratch. All right?
m489	HAN	Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She's the fastest ship in the fleet.
m489	LANDO	Oh well someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab.
m489	HAN	Well look at you a general huh?
m489	LANDO	Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later.
m489	HAN	Guess I owe you some thanks too Lando.
m489	LANDO	All right! A little higher! Just a little higher!
m489	HAN	It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.
m489	LANDO	No wait! I thought you were blind!
m489	HAN	Chewie! Chewie give me the gun. Don't move Lando.
m489	HAN	I'm trying!
m489	LANDO	Lower it!
m489	HAN	Lando grab it!
m489	HAN	Lando!
m489	LANDO	Han! Chewie?
m489	HAN	Let's see.
m489	THREEPIO	Oh Princess Leia are you all right?
m489	HAN	Well I suppose I could hotwire this thing.
m489	THREEPIO	My goodness! Artoo why did you have to be so brave?
m489	THREEPIO	Oh Artoo hurry!
m489	HAN	Come on! Come on!
m489	THREEPIO	We're coming!
m489	THREEPIO	I'm rather embarrassed General Solo but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor.
m489	HAN	What did he say?
m489	THREEPIO	It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.
m489	HAN	Proper?!
m489	THREEPIO	I beg your pardon General Solo but that just wouldn't be proper.
m489	HAN	Well why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?
m489	THREEPIO	Hello I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect.  But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.
m489	HAN	What are you telling them?
m489	HAN	All right hang on.
m489	THREEPIO	Here we go again.
m489	HAN	On second thought let's pass on that huh?
m489	THREEPIO	In his belly you will find a new definition of pain and suffering as you are slowly digested over a thousand years.
m489	THREEPIO	You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc.
m489	HAN	Good I hate long waits.
m489	THREEPIO	Oh dear. His High Exaltedness the great Jabba the Hutt has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately.
m489	VADER	I hope so Commander for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am.
m489	JERJERROD	We shall double our efforts.
m489	VADER	That is correct Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress.
m489	VADER	Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.
m489	JERJERROD	But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
m489	VADER	The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
m489	JERJERROD	I tell you this station will be operational as planned.
m489	VADER	Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.
m489	JERJERROD	I assure you Lord Vader my men are working as fast as they can.
m489	VADER	You may dispense with the pleasantries Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule.
m489	JERJERROD	Lord Vader this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence.
m489	WEDGE	Copy Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out.
m489	LANDO	All right Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower.
m489	WEDGE	There it is!
m489	WEDGE	Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast.
m489	LANDO	Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator.
m489	LANDO	Here goes nothing.
m489	WEDGE	I'm going in.
m489	LANDO	Now...come on Han old buddy. Don't let me down.
m489	WEDGE	Good shot Red Two.
m489	WEDGE	Red Leader standing by.
m489	LANDO	All wings report in.
m489	LEIA	Oh no.
m489	THREEPIO	I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
m489	LEIA	Quiet.
m489	THREEPIO	Oh! Oh my. Uh Princess Leia!
m489	THREEPIO	He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.
m489	LEIA	What's he saying?
m489	THREEPIO	Your Royal Highness.
m489	LEIA	Oh!
m489	THREEPIO	Ohhh I can't bear to watch.
m489	LEIA	Ugh!
m489	LUKE	Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try.
m489	LEIA	But why must you confront him?
m489	LUKE	No you don't. You've always been strong.
m489	LEIA	No! Luke run away far away. If he can feel your presence then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.
m489	LUKE	Then you know why I have to face him.
m489	LEIA	I know. Somehow...I've always known.
m489	LUKE	Yes. It's you Leia.
m489	LUKE	You're wrong Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it.
m489	LEIA	Luke don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have.
m489	LUKE	There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it but you must. If I don't make it back you're the only hope for the Alliance.
m489	LEIA	Your father?
m489	LUKE	He's my father.
m489	LUKE	Vader is here...now on this moon.
m489	LEIA	Luke tell me. What's troubling you?
m489	LUKE	I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.
m489	LEIA	She was very beautiful. Kind but...sad.  Why are you asking me all this?
m489	LUKE	Tell me.
m489	LEIA	Just...images really. Feelings.
m489	LUKE	What do you remember?
m489	LEIA	Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
m489	LUKE	Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?
m489	LUKE	I see them. Wait Leia!
m489	LEIA	Over there! Two more of them!
m489	LUKE	Never-r-r!
m489	VADER	Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side then perhaps she will.
m489	VADER	Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your friends. Yes your thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially for...
m489	LUKE	I will not fight you.
m489	VADER	You cannot hide forever Luke.
m489	VADER	You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight then you will meet your destiny.
m489	LUKE	You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before and I don't believe you'll destroy me now.
m489	VADER	There is no conflict.
m489	LUKE	Your thoughts betray you father. I feel the good in you...the conflict.
m489	LUKE	I will not fight you father.
m489	VADER	Obi-Wan has taught you well.
m489	VADER	It is too late for me son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now.
m489	LUKE	Search your feelings father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.
m489	VADER	If that is your destiny.
m489	LUKE	I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.
m489	VADER	You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.
m489	VADER	Obi-Wan once thought as you do.
m489	LUKE	Come with me.
m489	VADER	So you have accepted the truth.
m489	LUKE	I know father.
m489	VADER	The Emperor has been expecting you.
m489	YODA	Remember a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.  But beware.  Anger fear aggression. The dark side are they.  Once you start down the dark path forever will it dominate your destiny.
m489	LUKE	Well I'm sorry.
m489	LUKE	Unfortunate that I know the truth?
m489	YODA	Unexpected this is and unfortunate...
m489	LUKE	Yes.
m489	YODA	Told you did he?
m489	YODA	Your father he is.
m489	LUKE	Yoda I must know.
m489	YODA	No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.
m489	LUKE	But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.
m489	YODA	Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force.
m489	LUKE	Master Yoda you can't die.
m489	THREEPIO	Disintegrated?
m489	NINEDENINE	Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.
m489	THREEPIO	I am fluent in over six million forms of communication and can readily...
m489	NINEDENINE	How many languages do you speak?
m489	THREEPIO	Oh. Well yes.
m489	NINEDENINE	Yes or no will do.
m489	THREEPIO	I am See-Threepio human-cy...
m489	NINEDENINE	Ah good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid are you not?
m491	ROCKY	C'mon it's true -- But that don't bother me -- I just wanna prove somethin' -- I ain't no bum... It don't matter if I lose... Don't matter if he opens my head... The only thing I wanna do is go the distance -- That's all. Nobody's ever gone fifteen rounds with Creed. If I go them fifteen rounds an' that bell rings an' I'm still standin' I'm gonna know then I weren't just another bum from the neighborhood...
m491	ADRIAN	Don't say that.
m491	ROCKY	It ain't so bad 'cause I was a nothin' before --
m491	ADRIAN	Oh Rocky -- you worked so hard.
m491	ROCKY	...I dunno.
m491	ADRIAN	What're we going to do?
m491	ROCKY	I been watchin' the movies -- studyin' -- He ain't weak nowhere.
m491	ROCKY	Yeah I can't beat him.
m491	ADRIAN	Apollo?
m491	ROCKY	...I can't beat him.
m491	ADRIAN	...What?
m491	ROCKY	...Can't do it.
m491	ROCKY	I gotta go out for a while.
m491	ADRIAN	Is everything all right?
m491	ROCKY	I don't want ya cleanin' nobody else's cages no more.
m491	ADRIAN	What did you say about a pet shop?
m491	ROCKY	...What?
m491	ADRIAN	What was that you said about a pet shop?
m491	ROCKY	Yeah...
m491	ADRIAN	Rocky do you realize everybody in this country knows your face and after the fight everybody in the world is going to.
m491	ADRIAN	...Yes --
m491	ROCKY	Wanna hear a dirty joke?
m491	ROCKY	...What's to say? I dunno what he wants from me --
m491	ADRIAN	...Are you going to say anything to him?
m491	ROCKY	Yo -- I ain't mad. I'm just outta joint when reporters are around -- They take cheap shots an' Paulie knows it.
m491	ADRIAN	Don't be mad at him -- He just wants to help.
m491	ROCKY	Yeah... Threw my whole day off.
m491	ADRIAN	...And he called the reporters --
m491	ROCKY	Ya right --  Mebbe we best just hold hands -- the shirt made me feel guilty y'know.
m491	ADRIAN	I thought it might be cute.
m491	ROCKY	Yeah... But I think weak legs ain't bad sometimes y'know.
m491	ADRIAN	-- The legs.
m491	ROCKY	Can't fool around -- You look very great.
m491	ADRIAN	Don't want weak legs.
m491	ROCKY	Adrian you really look great y'know -- But I can't fool around durin' trainin' -- makes the legs weak.
m491	ROCKY	No... Sharp -- You look great.
m491	ADRIAN	Really -- You don't think they're overly feminine?
m491	ROCKY	Sharp -- Real nice.
m491	ADRIAN	Like?
m491	ROCKY	They either say 'Kill the nigger' or 'Hope you die Honky.' -- What ya got in the bag?
m491	ADRIAN	Don't you open them anymore?
m491	ROCKY	It did.
m491	ADRIAN	Yes.
m491	ROCKY	Y'know how I said that stuff on television didn't bother me?
m491	ADRIAN	I'll be waiting.
m491	ROCKY	'Bout seven.
m491	ADRIAN	Absolutely -- What time should I expect you?
m491	ROCKY	Ya puttin' me on right?
m491	ADRIAN	I don't know -- I was shocked. Why did you do that?
m491	ROCKY	How'd ya like hearin' ya name on TV?
m491	ADRIAN	Don't tease me.
m491	ROCKY	I always knew you was pretty.
m491	ROCKY	Could ya take off that hat.
m491	ADRIAN	...What?
m491	ROCKY	Do me another favor?
m491	ADRIAN	...T-thank you.
m491	ROCKY	The glasses... Please.
m491	ADRIAN	What?
m491	ROCKY	Would ya take off your glasses?
m491	ROCKY	But I'm willin' to make the best of this uncomfortable situation.
m491	ADRIAN	I should leave.
m491	ROCKY	Yo I'm not comfortable either.
m491	ADRIAN	I'm not sure I know you well enough -- I don't think I'm comfortable.
m491	ROCKY	They're all the same.
m491	ADRIAN	...I've never been in a man's apartment before.
m491	ROCKY	It's all right -- You're my guest.
m491	ADRIAN	No I don't belong here.
m491	ROCKY	It's okay.
m491	ADRIAN	I don't think I belong here.
m491	ROCKY	What's the problem? You don't like me -- Don't like the turtles -- What is it?
m491	ADRIAN	It's not that --
m491	ROCKY	It's only temporary.
m491	ADRIAN	It's fine.
m491	ROCKY	What's the matter? Ya don't like the room?
m491	ROCKY	I'll call your brother.
m491	ADRIAN	I think he might be worried.
m491	ROCKY	Why?
m491	ADRIAN	Yes.
m491	ROCKY	You sure?
m491	ADRIAN	Yes I do.
m491	ROCKY	D'you really wanna call?
m491	ADRIAN	I wanna let my brother know where I am.
m491	ROCKY	I had it pulled. People callin' all the time.  Who needs it -- Who'd you wanna call?
m491	ADRIAN	Do you have a phone?
m491	ROCKY	...Oh yeah I bought the whole kit -- Yeah ya sold me the turtles the bowl an' the mountain -- I had to get rid of the mountain 'cause they kept fallin' off.
m491	ADRIAN	I sold them to you.
m491	ROCKY	Here's the guys I was tellin' ya about -- This is Cuff an' Link.
m491	ADRIAN	...No thanks.
m491	ROCKY	Would ya like a glass of water?
m491	ADRIAN	'Cause you can't sing or dance?
m491	ROCKY	...Guess.
m491	ADRIAN	Why do you do it if it hurts so bad?
m491	ROCKY	After a rough fight ya' nothin' but a large wound. Sometimes I feel like callin' a taxi to drive me from my bed to the bathroom... Ya' eyes hurt ya' ears hurt ya' hair even hurts... But the thing I'm proud of is I been in over sixty fights an' never had a busted nose -- Bent an' twisted an' bitten but never broke... That's rare.
m491	ADRIAN	Morning after?
m491	ROCKY	...I'm at least half a bum. Yeah fightin' is a crazy racket. The roughest part is the mornin' after.
m491	ADRIAN	I don't think you're a bum.
m491	ROCKY	Ya gotta be a little soft to wanna be a pug... It's a racket where ya' almost guaranteed to end up a bum.
m491	ADRIAN	...It is just hard for me to understand why anybody wants to be a fighter.
m491	ROCKY	Then why did I bother bringin' it up? 'Cause I'm dumb that's why... Y'know I think we make a real sharp coupla coconuts -- I'm dumb an' you're shy.
m491	ADRIAN	It doesn't bother me either.
m491	ROCKY	Some people think bein' shy is a disease but it don't bother me.
m491	ADRIAN	...I suppose.
m491	ROCKY	I would say you're very shy by nature.
m491	ADRIAN	...I suppose.
m491	ROCKY	Some people are very shy by nature.
m491	ADRIAN	My mother told me just the opposite. She said 'You weren't born with much of a body so you'd better develop your brain.'
m491	ROCKY	What's funny?
m491	ADRIAN	By accident?
m491	ROCKY	Y'know how I got started in the fight racket?
m491	ADRIAN	Ohh!
m491	ROCKY	I just dislocated my finger.
m491	ROCKY	Absolutely.
m491	ADRIAN	But you never had a chance to prove yourself.
m491	ADRIAN	And you never got the chance?
m491	ROCKY	Ain't skated since I was fifteen -- That's when I started fightin' -- gotta watch the ankles. Yeah fightin' use to be tops with me but no more. All I wanted to prove was I weren't no bum -- That I had the stuff to make a good pro.
m491	ADRIAN	...Aren't you skating?
m491	ROCKY	I think mebbe we're early or somethin' --
m491	ADRIAN	I think it's closed.
m491	ROCKY	Looks quiet y'know.
m491	ROCKY	To you to me it's Thursday.
m491	ADRIAN	It's Thanksgiving.
m491	ADRIAN	...Goodnight Rocky.
m491	ROCKY	Hey how's my buddy doin'?  -- Nice dog -- Well I'll see ya later.
m491	ROCKY	Shell-shocked!
m491	ADRIAN	...I don't know.
m491	ROCKY	I smack 'em hard on the shell an' they get... What?
m491	ROCKY	Ain't your fault -- Here's the problem.
m491	ADRIAN	...I'm sorry.
m491	ROCKY	Me I'm kinda aggravated.
m491	ADRIAN	...Fine.
m491	ROCKY	...How's the turtle food this week?
m491	PAULIE	You a virgin? -- Ya let 'im in ya pants didn't ya!  Ya pulled down ya pants an' let him have it didn't ya!!
m491	ADRIAN	What?!
m491	PAULIE	You busted?!
m491	ADRIAN	Good? Good Paulie?! I've been treatin' you like a baby. Since I can't remember it's so long -- I'm the only one who feeds you an' puts you in bed when ya can't stand up -- and it's you that made me feel like a loser -- That's what ya use to call me 'Loser' -- What kind of name is that? So can ya blame me for not remembering to talk about you when I'm with Rocky -- I don't owe you Paulie you owe me.
m491	PAULIE	You owe me an' are supposed to treat me good!
m491	ADRIAN	Owe you what?
m491	PAULIE	Get away from me -- I could never even get married 'cause you couldn't live by yaself -- ya'd die by yaself! So instead I put you two together -- Did ya think of puttin' in a good word for me? -- You owe me!
m491	ADRIAN	Don't do that again!
m491	PAULIE	I always seen ya had the best but did ya ever think of puttin' in a good word for me with this scumbag!
m491	ADRIAN	You gave me what?! Knots! You gave me knots in here every day -- you made me scared of everything!
m491	PAULIE	You forget what I went through to give ya the best.
m491	ADRIAN	Only a pig would say that!
m491	PAULIE	I want 'im outta here --  Don't think I'm good enough to work for Gazzo?  That's what I think of bums like you an' Gazzo!  You're goin' up an' don't care enough to throw Paulie some crumbs!  I give ya meat an' I give ya my sister too!
m491	ADRIAN	...Paulie. Stop now!
m491	PAULIE	Get outta my life both of ya's.
m491	ADRIAN	Don't talk like that to him!
m491	PAULIE	You ain't no friend no more -- Go home! Outta my house I want ya!
m491	ADRIAN	It's not your house --
m491	PAULIE	Shutup! I want nothin' -- I ain't no charity case! Get outta my house!
m491	ADRIAN	Paulie!
m491	PAULIE	Nothin'! I want nothin' from you!!!
m491	ADRIAN	Roosevelt finished last in his class -- Beethoven was deaf an' Helen Keller was blind -- I think Rocky has a good chance.
m491	PAULIE	That so.
m491	ADRIAN	Einstein flunked out of school... twice.
m491	ADRIAN	You didn't!
m491	PAULIE	Christ.
m491	ADRIAN	Oh Rocky!
m491	ADRIAN	Paul.
m491	PAULIE	Do me a favor -- His lungs punch 'em out.
m491	ADRIAN	Paulie it's Thanksgiving. I've gotta turkey in the oven.
m491	PAULIE	Why?
m491	ADRIAN	I can't go out.
m491	PAULIE	Don't get wise with me. I want ya to stop bein' a loser.
m491	ADRIAN	...Like you?
m491	PAULIE	Hey I want ya out instamaticly. -- I'm sicka lookin' at ya hangin' around like a friggin' spider -- Go out -- Live! Do enjoy life.
m491	ADRIAN	Paulie please --
m491	PAULIE	Ya ya goin' outta the bedroom an' I don't wanna know from nothin'.
m491	ADRIAN	No... I can't!
m491	PAULIE	Like it would make a difference if you were right? This guy's a friend and now he's takin' ya out.
m491	ADRIAN	...Paulie why didn't you tell me you were bringing him home?! Look at me I'm not ready for this.
m491	APOLLO	...Thanks.
m491	TRAINER	Cover the ribs -- Look here elbow down tight -- Tight -- stand straight -- you're the best you're the best!
m491	APOLLO	...Stop jivin'!
m491	TRAINER	Don't kill yourself man -- Let the doctor stop the fight.
m491	APOLLO	One more round.
m491	TRAINER	Yo' bleedin' inside man -- Get that doctor.
m491	APOLLO	No doctor!... I'm feelin' good bro!
m491	TRAINER	You're hurtin' man!
m491	APOLLO	No doctor!
m491	TRAINER	Get that doctor.
m491	APOLLO	My side.
m491	TRAINER	Luck! You fightin' a crazy man -- but you got him hurt bad.  More ice now!
m491	APOLLO	He got lucky.
m491	TRAINER	He's movin' to your left -- don't let him no more -- dance and stick hear? Don't play -- I know what ya feelin' but don't play.
m491	APOLLO	...That man's takin' his job too serious.
m491	TRAINER	People nothin' you in a fight my man -- ya best believe what you hear... Knock that boy out soon an' let's go home.
m491	APOLLO	Man I rearranged his face with that right -- The people love what's happenin' tonight.
m491	TRAINER	Don't play with this man he's fightin' hard -- Let 'em feel some real heat!
m491	APOLLO	I'll carry him 'till the third.
m491	TRAINER	Sure -- He can hit -- Don't play no more -- Stick an' move hear?
m491	APOLLO	...That boy damn near broke my arm.
m491	APOLLO	Southpaw nuthin' -- I'll drop 'im in three -- 'Apollo Creed meets the Italian Stallion.' Shhiii -- Sounds like a damn monster movie!!
m491	TRAINER	I don't like you messin' with southpaws -- They do everything wrong.
m491	APOLLO	Listen I gonna carry this boy three rounds then drop 'im like a bad habit.
m491	TRAINER	He won't last one round.
m491	APOLLO	...I don't feel heat from the name.
m491	TRAINER	Too old dull fighter.  Bobby Judge is a good boy.
m491	APOLLO	Give my main man a raise!!
m491	TRAINER	You's the novelty Champ!
m491	APOLLO	I do -- Maybe what this fight needs is something new -- a novelty.
m491	APOLLO	Don't matter -- That name. 'The Italian Stallion' it's right on.  Who discovered America? An Italian right? So man what could be better than to get it on with one of his ancestors --
m491	JERGENS	Rocky Balboa -- His record's poor --
m491	APOLLO	'The Italian Stallion' -- He's my man.
m491	APOLLO	...This man.
m491	JERGENS	Exactly what are you looking for Apollo?
m491	APOLLO	...Still don't feel no heat.
m491	JERGENS	Joe Zack is a good prospect -- Exciting boy.
m491	APOLLO	How 'bout this Big Chuck Smith?
m491	JERGENS	Fouls.
m491	APOLLO	How 'bout this Billy Snow?
m491	APOLLO	No man it's very smart.
m491	JERGENS	...It's very American.
m491	APOLLO	Now here's what's goin' down. Listen 'cause I'm gonna say this but one time. On January first the first day of the Bicentennial I'm gonna fight me a local poor underdog dig? A snow-white underdog. An' I'm gonna put his face on this poster with me hear? An' I'll tell you why 'cause I'm sentimental -- An' all the people in the country all sentimental man an' they'd like nothin' better than me Apollo Creed to let some unknown get a shot at the greatest title in the world on this country's biggest birthday. Now that's the way I see it an' that's the way I want it!!
m491	JERGENS	Apollo I'm sure there's a way to salvage this.
m491	APOLLO	Shape nothin' -- They're afraid. They know everybody in the world's gonna see this fight an' none of them gotta prayer of beating me so they're makin' excuses so they don't have to be the chump that's gonna be whipped in front of the whole civilized world!!
m491	JERGENS	Shaw's fighting in South America -- Why not postpone the bout until July Fourth?
m491	APOLLO	Then gimme Buddy Shaw -- He's ranked fifth.
m491	JERGENS	I contacted Ernie Roman's manager he's fighting in France the same week.
m491	APOLLO	You best find me another ranked contender an' I mean in a flash man!
m491	JERGENS	I suppose we could cancel the fight indefinitely if you are set on fighting Green.
m491	APOLLO	Damn.
m491	APOLLO	...Stay in school an' use your brains dig -- Be a lawyer be a doctor carry a leather briefcase an' forget about sports!! Sports can only make ya grunt an' smell -- Be a thinker not a stinker!!
m491	COMMENTATOR	Any quick advice for young boxing hopefuls?
m491	APOLLO	Me an' my wife are goin' home 'cause we miss our children an' can't go no more time without seein' them.
m491	COMMENTATOR	Where're you off to now?
m491	APOLLO	The Bicentennial Heavyweight Championship of the World is gonna be held in the only place it can be held -- Philadelphia! -- the nation's cradle -- January First -- the first major event of our two hundredth year.
m491	COMMENTATOR	Still to be held in Philadelphia?
m491	APOLLO	That's right -- It's gonna be the greatest sportin' event in this country's history -- A gala occurrence!
m491	COMMENTATOR	You're referring to the much publicized bicentennial fight?
m491	APOLLO	He was big an' very nasty so I destroyed him in a hurry -- Now I'm gettin' ready for Mac Lee Green next month.
m491	COMMENTATOR	Apollo how would you rate this last British challenger Henry Wilcoxson?
m491	APOLLO	Very high an' very fast.
m491	COMMENTATOR	How was the flight Champ?
m491	ROCKY	Move your shoulders down.
m491	BODYGUARD	Kiss my ass.
m491	ROCKY	Don't like yours neither.
m491	BODYGUARD	I don't like ya face.
m491	ROCKY	Does that bum have to say that?
m491	BODYGUARD	Take 'er to the zoo -- Retards like the zoo.
m491	ROCKY	She ain't retarded she's shy.
m491	BODYGUARD	Hear she's retarded.
m491	BODYGUARD	...Of the truck that run over your face.
m491	ROCKY	Of wa?
m491	BODYGUARD	Did ya get the license number?
m491	ROCKY	Pull heat on me? -- I'll dent ya face!
m491	CHIPPED TOOTH	We'll kill you man -- We gotta gun.
m491	CHIPPED TOOTH	Buy us some Thunderbird man.
m491	ROCKY	...That's an old one.
m491	CHIPPED TOOTH	Hey give Rocky a dime.
m491	ROCKY	No dollar.
m491	CHIPPED TOOTH	'Cause we dig ya man -- Gimme a dollar.
m491	ROCKY	Why?
m491	CHIPPED TOOTH	Yo Rock gimme a dollar.
m491	ROCKY	No wine.
m491	CHIPPED TOOTH	C'mon man it's cold man.
m491	ROCKY	...No wine -- Bad for ya' brain.
m491	CHIPPED TOOTH	Yo Rocks buy us sum wine man.
m491	ROCKY	Charge it.
m491	CLEANER	...How 'bout for the Cokes?
m491	ROCKY	I must be goin' deaf 'cause I thought ya said 'ten cents.'
m491	CLEANER	That's ten bucks.
m491	ROCKY	Yeah -- My ol' man who was never the sharpest told me -- I weren't born with much brain so I better use my body.
m491	CLEANER	Here -- Three minutes.
m491	ROCKY	This guy is beautiful -- get the Cokes.
m491	CLEANER	Cost ya a buck.
m491	ROCKY	How 'bout some Cokes?
m491	CLEANER	Six!
m491	ROCKY	It ain't your fault -- I originally done it in the Baby Crenshaw fight.  That's me fightin' Big Baby Crenshaw -- Big Baby was the size of an airplane an' I broke my hands on his head -- I lost but it's a nice picture don't ya think?
m491	CLEANER	Seven minutes!
m491	ROCKY	Hey I ain't cryin'... I still fight. Kinda do it like a hobby. See I'm a natural southpaw an' most pugs won't fight a southpaw 'cause we mess up their timin' an' look awkward -- Southpaw means lefthanded... But I guess in the long run things probably worked out for the best right?
m491	CLEANER	Nine minutes!
m491	ROCKY	...Yeah give 'er the Blades.
m491	CLEANER	Ten minutes for ten dollars.
m491	ROCKY	...Ten minutes.
m491	CLEANER	Few minutes?
m491	ROCKY	Look at her ya can see she ain't feelin' good -- needs a few minutes exercise --
m491	CLEANER	This a con?
m491	ROCKY	Listen I gotta problem. This girl ain't feelin' well y'know -- The doctor says she should exercise y'know once in awhile an' ice skatin' is the best thing --
m491	CLEANER	Yo pal what's with you -- The place ain't operatin'.
m491	ROCKY	Wait here gotta smooth this guy out.
m491	CLEANER	Hey the rink is empty 'cause we're closed -- ya ain't allowed in here so do me a favor an' not stay here.
m491	ROCKY	Are ya closed to the General Public or to just everybody.
m491	CLEANER	Hey whatta ya doin' here -- we're closed... Yo we're closed!
m491	COMMENTATOR #2	Not only has he refused to fall but he has beaten the Champion's body without mercy and the bout has become a vicious slugfest.
m491	COMMENTATOR #1	Without a doubt this is the most punishing brawl I have ever seen -- The ringside audience is spotted with blood. This fight should have been stopped rounds ago but Rocky Balboa refuses to fall --
m491	COMMENTATOR #1	No way -- but the brilliant ability of the Champion to master situations like this is one of his most outstanding traits -- Creed tosses a perfect right hand that rocks Rocky. Creed on the offensive -- Balboa takes the punishment and counters with a left flush over the heart... that hurt.
m491	COMMENTATOR #2	There's no way Apollo expected this kind of hitting power.
m491	COMMENTATOR #1	Apollo almost sprints out of his corner -- feints and throws a pair of left-right combinations. Balboa drops beneath a left upper cut and lands a very solid shot on Creed's temple -- not much movement from Balboa duck a left a right another left and explodes with a right hook to the temple -- I mean explodes. The Champ backs off.
m491	COMMENTATOR #1	Round three ready to start and should be interesting to see if Creed can put the challenger away -- there goes the bell.
m491	COMMENTATOR #2	If you had asked anyone who knows boxing they never would've predicted a first round knockdown and the second round punishment to the body of the Champion... Most fighters will tell you receiving a good body punch is the next worst thing to dying.
m491	COMMENTATOR #1	Creed is down!!!
m491	COMMENTATOR #2	The Champion is smiling and toying with the man -- trying to give the fans their money's worth and make a show of it with the badly out-classes challenger -- Another left to right combination. I feel sorry for --
m491	COMMENTATOR #1	The Champ stings the slower challenger with jabs at will -- Balboa blocks eighty percent of the blows with his face -- Creed doesn't look the best he's ever been but is moving smoothly -- Creed snaps out a triple combination that backs Balboa into a corner -- oh a solid hook by Creed a master of fist-men.
m491	COMMENTATOR #1	I agree.
m491	COMMENTATOR #2	It's been confirmed that it is definitely an impersonation of George Washington -- a great way to start 1976 off.
m491	COMMENTATOR #1	Am I seeing right? Creed is approaching the ring in a boat. Is he supposed to be George Washington? Obviously so.
m491	COMMENTATOR #2	You could go deaf with the noise -- it undoubtedly means Champion Apollo Creed is heading towards the ring --
m491	COMMENTATOR #1	I only wonder if this man has the skill to go past three rounds -- Vegas odds say 'no.'
m491	COMMENTATOR #2	Thank you Bob. The electricity is everywhere tonight. Rocky Balboa a fifty-to-one underdog is living a Cinderella story which has captured peoples' imaginations all over the world -- to quote a popular sports magazine 'The fighting style should be 'The Caveman Against the Cavalier.' From the increase in sound it appears the challenger is now approaching the ring... His record is forty-four wins twenty losses and thirty-eight knockouts.
m491	COMMENTATOR #1	We would like to welcome our viewing audience to the Grand World Championship Bicentennial Heavyweight Fight -- the first major event of the Bicentennial Year... A point of interest is that the fight is being beamed to more than seven hundred and fifty million fans in theatres in nearly every corner of the world. I would like to welcome an old friend and co-commentator for this evening's event -- Jimmy Michaels.
m491	MICKEY	Not yellow cautious.  See it's very easy for a fighter to accidentally hurt --
m491	DIPPER	Yo' yellow old man.
m491	DIPPER	Don't mouth me old man I'll knock yo' out too. C'mon wop spar me let everybody see who's got the heat around here.
m491	MICKEY	Why let Rocky here take a chance on cuttin' or breakin' a hand? -- Take a shower Dipper.
m491	DIPPER	Yo' know I iz the best man here! Yo' said so yoself!
m491	MICKEY	You can forget about sparring kid.
m491	DIPPER	I'm happenin'! This pig is takin' my shot -- I iz a contender. He's nothin'.

m491	DIPPER	I say ya nothin'!

m491	ROCKY	Ya still light seventy.
m491	FATS	I know the juice is climbin' -- I been workin' six months just to pay the damn interest.
m491	ROCKY	...The juice is climbin' every week.
m491	FATS	You have my food in ya hand.
m491	ROCKY	What about for food an' stuff?
m491	FATS	That's it.
m491	ROCKY	That's it? -- Completely?
m491	FATS	That's it I'm broke.

m491	FATS	Bob.
m491	ROCKY	What's ya name again?
m491	FATS	Please I need my hands to work -- Christ don't bust my thumbs.
m491	ROCKY	Mr. Gazzo says I should get two hundred or break the thumb.
m491	FATS	Honest to God I'm broke -- Gimme a break.
m491	ROCKY	Mr. Gazzo wants the two hundred now!
m491	FATS	Don't hit the face! Not the face!!
m491	GAZZO	Where else am I gonna go.  Bet three grand on Rocky.
m491	ROCKY	Yo you gonna show Tony?
m491	GAZZO	Same thing. Ya know Rock remember when we was kids we fought together. An' I wasn't well an' ya had to beat up that Irish kid -- what's his name? -- Gallager -- I bought a suit and became a businessman. You put on gloves. An' I remember Mama almost cried may she rest in peace -- an' our ol' man who said ya had no brains --I'd like to lay hands on that bastard. You ain't never had any luck. Even when I owned you in '66 you never had luck. But now I think you might be gettin' some luck kid. Whatta you think?
m491	ROCKY	Black market?
m491	GAZZO	Sure you do what ya want. Stay away from the stock market.
m491	ROCKY	I'm gonna do somethin with it.
m491	GAZZO	Ya gettin 150 grand killer. Ya got any plans for it? Whatta ya think? Ya like to put it on the street make it work for ya?
m491	ROCKY	No action.
m491	GAZZO	Listen kid I'm with ya. Ya know I'm with ya -- Italian we're blood. You kill this rug -- We Guinneas gotta show these Afro-Americans where it's at. Give it your best shot cause I want ya to prove to these bums on the corner that my man can't be beat by this rug... Ya got any action on the side.
m491	ROCKY	Gonna try.
m491	GAZZO	Does Santa Claus charge juice? Merry Christmas -- Now how's about my present ya gonna win?
m491	ROCKY	Do I have to pay juice?
m491	GAZZO	Here's five hundred -- Put it in your glove.
m491	ROCKY	A few bucks.
m491	GAZZO	Take your shot kid -- You got money for trainin' expenses?
m491	ROCKY	I feel bad about walkin'.
m491	GAZZO	Hey -- if a good man can make a better life let him make it.
m491	ROCKY	Y'know I won't be able to work for ya no more.
m491	ROCKY	Thanks Mr. Gazzo.
m491	GAZZO	Here's fifty bucks -- You an' the girl have a nice time.
m491	ROCKY	Yeah.
m491	GAZZO	Buddy's got a thing against ya Rock. Some people just hate for no reason y'know.
m491	ROCKY	He's always in a bad mood.  Count ya blessin's. Ya a healthy person -- ya legs work -- ya hands work --
m491	GAZZO	Buddy's in a bad mood -- prostate problems.
m491	ROCKY	Paulie's sister.
m491	GAZZO	You think I don't hear things?
m491	ROCKY	How'd you know?
m491	GAZZO	Hey screw ya brain on right. Now who's this girl you're going out with tonight?
m491	ROCKY	Ya sure?
m491	GAZZO	No two yards from Snyder an' a grand from Cappoli.
m491	ROCKY	Next Wednesday I grab a grand from Snyder. An' Thursday two yards from Cappoli okay?
m491	GAZZO	It don't matter. It's my reputation. These guys think they can get off light. It's bad for my reputation -- It's bad for business. See ya killer.
m491	ROCKY	I figure if I break the thumb this guy gets thrown outta his job and can't pay nothin' no more.
m491	GAZZO	Yo Rock. Did I give you a job this mornin? How come ya didn't break this guy's thumb like I asked ya? When ya don't do what ya are told it makes me look bad kid.
m491	ROCKY	...Fine.
m491	GAZZO	Tomorrow collect from Del Rio -- He's late three weeks. How'd you do last night?
m491	GAZZO	Sure Rocky Bob's good for it...
m491	ROCKY	He only had a hundred an' thirty. -- I think he's good for the rest next week Mr. Gazzo.
m491	JERGENS	Not spar I'm asking whether you would be interested in fighting Creed for the championship.
m491	ROCKY	Sure an' I'm smart enough to know that no sparrin' partner should take cheap shots at the Champ. He's just there to help condition the man.
m491	JERGENS	Did you hear what I said?
m491	ROCKY	...Like I said I'd make a boss sparrin' mate.
m491	JERGENS	Rocky would you be interested in fighting Apollo Creed for the Championship?
m491	ROCKY	I wouldn't take no cheap shots. I'd be a good sparrin' partner.
m491	JERGENS	What?
m491	ROCKY	Absolutely -- Sparrin' with the Champ would be an honor -- y'know what?
m491	JERGENS	I'm sure you are.
m491	ROCKY	I know ya need sparrin' partners -- I'm very available.
m491	JERGENS	Excuse me.
m491	ROCKY	Sparrin'?
m491	JERGENS	Rocky would you be interested in --
m491	ROCKY	No -- Just me.
m491	JERGENS	Rocky do you have any representation? A manager?
m491	ROCKY	Rocky.
m491	JERGENS	Mr. Balboa --
m491	ROCKY	...Thanks.
m491	JERGENS	Hello Mr. Balboa -- I'm Miles Jergens -- Please have a seat.
m491	ROCKY	'Night Marie.
m491	MARIE	Goodnight Rocky.
m491	ROCKY	Ya somethin' like that.
m491	MARIE	Ya hope I don't keep acting like a whore or I'll turn into one right?
m491	ROCKY	What was I gonna say?
m491	MARIE	I won't.
m491	ROCKY	Listen I hope ya don't --
m491	ROCKY	Yo a bad reputation -- Twenty years from now people will say 'D'you remember Marie?' 'No who was she?' 'She was that little whore who hung out at the Atomic Hoagie Shop.' 'Oh now I remember!'... See they don't remember you they remember the rep.
m491	MARIE	What?
m491	ROCKY	That doesn't matter -- You don't really have to be a whore just act like one an' that's it.
m491	MARIE	C'mon Rocky. I'm twelve.
m491	ROCKY	'Cause that's the way guys are -- They laugh when ya talk dirty. They think ya cute for a while but then ya getta reputation an' watch out. Nobody's ever gonna take ya serious. Ya get no respect... I gotta use a bad word -- Whore. You'll end up maybe becomin' a whore.
m491	MARIE	Why?
m491	ROCKY	Nobody likes garbage -- Anyway this girl with the dirty mouth wasn't bad lookin' but the guys wouldn't take her out for any serious datin'.
m491	MARIE	Maybe I like garbage.
m491	ROCKY	Makes your breath like garbage.
m491	MARIE	I like yella teeth.
m491	ROCKY	Make your teeth yella --
m491	MARIE	...Yeah.
m491	ROCKY	Hey! When I was your age there was only one girl who talked like that in the whole neighborhood.
m491	MARIE	I like 'em. If you don't you can f --
m491	ROCKY	How come ya wanna hang out with those guys? They teach ya bad things.
m491	ROCKY	Don't you never say that --  -- You guys talk like that in front of a little girl -- You guys are scum.
m491	MARIE	Stuff it man!
m491	ROCKY	What?
m491	MARIE	Hey --
m491	ROCKY	Did these guys teach you to talk dirty? Huh?
m491	MARIE	...Screw you yoyo.

m491	MICKEY	...Yeah.
m491	ROCKY	Would you keep goin'?
m491	MICKEY	Wanna keep goin'?
m491	ROCKY	See what?
m491	MICKEY	Gimme the water! Ya gettin' tagged with his right. I think you should feint left and high hook 'im -- Benny check the eyes! Can ya see?
m491	ROCKY	Fine... That guy's great.
m491	MICKEY	How you holdin' up kid?
m491	MICKEY	Why don't ya tell 'im you're a fan!
m491	ROCKY	...The guy's great.
m491	MICKEY	Can't hardly tell. Don't swallow the blood -- Go for his ribs. Don't let 'im breathe.
m491	ROCKY	Damn! How's it look?
m491	MICKEY	Ya nose is broke.
m491	MICKEY	Breathe deep -- Keep ya chin down!! Use the legs and drive through 'im. Attack -- Attack -- Attack!
m491	ROCKY	See how fast he is -- damn!
m491	MICKEY	Real good.
m491	ROCKY	How am I doin'?
m491	ROCKY	Thanks Mick -- I'm gonna try.
m491	MICKEY	God bless ya Rock.

m491	MICKEY	Check the eyes Ben.
m491	ROCKY	Yo Benny.
m491	MICKEY	What cha say Benny -- Meet 'The Rock.' This is our cutman Benny Stein.
m491	ROCKY	I never had good footwork.
m491	MICKEY	Tie it to both ankles -- Leave two feet slack.
m491	MICKEY	Rocky I'm seventy-six years old. Maybe you can be the winner I never was -- your shot is my last shot!
m491	ROCKY	I asked but ya never helped nothin'! -- Like the Bible sez ya don't get no second chance.
m491	MICKEY	If ya was wantin' my help why didn't ya ask? Just ask.
m491	ROCKY	Whatever I got I always got on the slide. This shot's no different. I didn't earn nothin' -- I got it on the slide... I needed ya help about ten years ago when I was startin' but ya never helped me none.
m491	MICKEY	Please kid.
m491	ROCKY	I got pain an' experience too.
m491	MICKEY	Look you can't buy what I know. Ya can't. I've seen it all! I got pain an' I got experience.
m491	ROCKY	The fight's set -- I don't need a manager.
m491	MICKEY	I'm sorry I -- I made a mistake. Kid I'm askin' man to man. I wanna be ya manager.
m491	ROCKY	...Ya gave Dipper my locker.
m491	MICKEY	Respect I always dished ya respect.
m491	ROCKY	Heart but I ain't got no Tocker.
m491	MICKEY	Ya got heart.
m491	ROCKY	Really think so?
m491	MICKEY	Yeah ya kinda remind me of the Rock. Ya move like 'im.
m491	ROCKY	Nobody ever said that -- There's his picture.
m491	ROCKY	Ya got a good mind for dates.
m491	MICKEY	I done it all. I've done an' seen everything'. Believe what I'm tellin' ya -- Ya shoulda seen the night in Brooklyn I smacked 'Ginny' Russo outta the ring September 14 1923 -- same night Firpo knocked Dempsey outta the ring. But who got the Press? He did. He had a manager -- September 14 1923.
m491	ROCKY	...What?
m491	MICKEY	Rocky d'ya know what I done?
m491	ROCKY	How 'bout a glass of water?
m491	MICKEY	Fifty years. The rep is known around Philly an' a good rep can't be bought but I don't have to tell you that.
m491	ROCKY	Fifty years huh.
m491	MICKEY	I'm here tellin' ya to be very smart with this shot. Like the Bible sez ya don't get no second chance.
m491	ROCKY	Turtles -- domestic turtles.
m491	MICKEY	Whatta' those?
m491	ROCKY	Freak luck is a strange thing.
m491	MICKEY	Look at all them other fighters. Real good boys. Good records. Colorful. Fight their hearts out for peanuts -- But who cared? Nobody. They got it shoved in their back door. Nobody ever give them a shot at the title...
m491	ROCKY	Freak luck for sure.
m491	MICKEY	What's happened is freak luck.
m491	ROCKY	Yeah.
m491	MICKEY	Listen Rock you're a very lucky guy.
m491	ROCKY	I'm usta seein' ya at the gym but seein' ya here in my house it's kinda outta joint.

m491	ROCKY	When was they here?
m491	MICKEY	Here's the card?
m491	ROCKY	Ya puttin' me on?

m491	ROCKY	Message -- What message?
m491	MICKEY	Did ya get the message kid?

m491	MICKEY	I don't care what nobody says this bum Creed woulda never made it in the Thirties --
m491	ROCKY	Open my eyes -- Please open my eyes!
m491	MIKE	No more ya wanna lose an eye? No more.
m491	ROCKY	He ain't losin' nothin'.

m491	ROCKY	Why?
m491	ROCKY	I didn't want no turkey anyway.
m491	PAULIE	Ice skate.
m491	ROCKY	What's ya sister like to do?
m491	PAULIE	Try again c'mon try again.
m491	ROCKY	...Maybe I better forget it.
m491	PAULIE	Forget nothin' -- Here talk to my sister tell 'er somethin' nice.
m491	ROCKY	Maybe ya better forget it.
m491	PAULIE	!! Ya want the bird go out in the alley an' eat the bird -- I want ya outta the house -- Enjoy ya friggin' life... Ya hungry Rock?
m491	PAULIE	Yeah sure -- She's very excited.
m491	ROCKY	Ya sister knows I'm comin'?
m491	ROCKY	Gazzo's gotta come to you -- Hey Paulie it's a bad job -- Do what you do now.

m491	PAULIE	Do me a favor -- Talk to Gazzo. Tell him I'm a friend an' would do a good job... Tell him I ain't bothered by nothin' an' would be a great collector... Bustin' bones don't bother me -- Tell him I'm a good worker.
m491	ROCKY	Maybe another job is the best thing.
m491	PAULIE	I don't need a doctor I need a different job.
m491	ROCKY	Maybe ya should see a doctor.
m491	PAULIE	Inflamed joints -- Walkin' in an' out of a freezer carryin' meat plays hell on the joints.
m491	PAULIE	Look at my hands -- See how the joints are swollen.
m491	ROCKY	What kinda business?
m491	PAULIE	I hate the friggin' game... I'd like to talk some business.
m491	ROCKY	I usta be deadly at half-ball.
m491	ROCKY	Absolutely...
m491	PAULIE	Tomorrow you come for some bird right?
m491	ROCKY	...Sure.
m491	PAULIE	The girl's dryin' up! She's gotta live a little before her body dries up!! You're a pal Rock -- How 'bout yo' talk to her? Y'know it's Thanksgivin' tomorrow.
m491	ROCKY	Let's get outta this stink.
m491	PAULIE	I wanna kill the friggin' moron who broke the mirror.
m491	ROCKY	I don't see no crowd around you neither.
m491	PAULIE	An' you're dyin' alone too.
m491	ROCKY	I'm thirty myself.
m491	PAULIE	She's a loser -- She don't enjoy life -- She reads -- Brainy -- Pushin' thirty friggin' years old!  She's gonna die alone if she don't wise up.
m491	PAULIE	...Adrian ain't sharp.
m491	ROCKY	Ya always in a bad mood --
m491	PAULIE	Ya caught me in a bad mood.
m491	ROCKY	Don't get mental man.
m491	PAULIE	Sometimes she gets me so crazy I'd like to split her head with a razor.
m491	ROCKY	Hey --
m491	PAULIE	My sister's a friggin' loser.
m491	ROCKY	Yeah like I was a plate of leftovers -- Somethin' wrong with my face -- Whatta I need a Caddy to connect with ya sister?
m491	PAULIE	Looks huh?
m491	ROCKY	Every mornin' every night I pass by -- I smile. I say jokes. Nothin'. She looks at me.
m491	PAULIE	Forget her. You could do better than my sister.
m491	ROCKY	Your sister's givin' me the shoulder.
m491	PAULIE	What?
m491	ROCKY	Yo Paulie.
m491	PAULIE	Yo Rocky -- Look at this mirror. I'd like to kill the friggin' moron who broke this mirror.
m491	ROCKY	Yo Paulie.
m491	ROCKY	Derogatory? Yeah he's great.
m491	REPORTER	Do you have anything derogatory to say about the Champion?
m491	ROCKY	I'll tear his head off.
m491	ROCKY	Maybe --
m491	REPORTER	Do you feel you have a chance?
m491	ROCKY	Apollo's a great fighter.
m491	REPORTER	We can cut that out later. Apollo Creed says he'll let you stay three rounds before he puts you away.
m491	REPORTER	How're you preparing for this Bicentennial bout?
m491	ROCKY	...People talk to me more.
m491	REPORTER	So much has happened lately -- Has it changed your life style much?
m491	ROCKY	Listen I wanna say hi to my girlfriend -- Yo Adrian!
m491	REPORTER #2	And now your payday will be one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Any comment?
m491	ROCKY	Four hundred -- But that was a long time ago.
m491	REPORTER #2	Is it true the most you've ever made in a prizefight is five hundred dollars?
m491	ROCKY	Creed's great ain't he... I'll do what I can.
m491	REPORTER #2	How will you fight Apollo Creed?
m491	ROCKY	Feel? I dunno... Happy.
m491	REPORTER #2	This is your largest payday ever -- How do you feel about it?
m529	BEN	May the Force be with you.
m529	HAN	We'll be back before you are old man.
m529	BEN	That's straight through the central core... up toward the top of the city... Once you've got her avoid the main transports they'll shut down immediately.  Your only chance is through the service shafts. There are no sensors there... All right now get going you don't have time.  I hope you can remember everything.
m529	HAN	I'm not going out there.
m529	BEN	There is a greater risk in staying here you know.  If you don't find the princess then the whole trip was for nothing... wasn't it?
m529	HAN	Don't look at me.  I'm just a pilot. I got you here... You've got to do the rest.
m529	BEN	It's not good... unless I could find the Crystal.  Then it could be very good.
m529	HAN	Is that good or bad?
m529	BEN	Darth Vader is on this system.  I can feel him.  I can feel the Kiber Crystal.
m529	HAN	What do you want with our scan-proof lockers?
m529	BEN	... and I want you to start cleaning the equipment out of the scan- shielded compartments.
m529	HAN	I'll get the information.
m529	BEN	All right then we'll use your plan.
m529	HAN	We're going to get in by studying Imperial procedures?  I don't like it.
m529	BEN	Check your data banks for all the information you have on Imperial procedures.  Both of you will have to learn...
m529	HAN	We're into the second perimeter. They'll be coming out to blast us shortly.  I was wondering if you had some kind of a plan or are we going to try to blast our way in?
m529	HAN	Not bad.
m529	BEN	You have your father's style.  You've done very well.
m529	HAN	I'm not afraid of anything...
m529	BEN	Fear is their greatest weapon.
m529	HAN	Kid you take the glory and the good intentions and I'll take the reward.
m529	HAN	This isn't a game you know.
m529	BEN	Luke's got a point... ... Fear is their greatest defense... I doubt if the actual security there is much greater than on Aquilae or Sullust and what there is is most likely directed toward large-scale assault.
m529	HAN	Anything I want!  Now that's interesting.
m529	BEN	A million at least... If this robot has information related to the destruction of Organa Major you'll be able to name the reward...
m529	HAN	How much do you think she's talking about?
m529	HAN	I'm beginning not to like you.
m529	BEN	I think there are some things we should talk about.
m529	HAN	Who's going to pay me then?
m529	BEN	Well for one reason we don't have your other five thousand.
m529	HAN	I'm not taking you on an impossible search across the galaxy... I was only paid to get you here and now you're here.  I'll take my other five thousand and you're on your own... I'll leave you on the nearest system.
m529	BEN	No not anymore.
m529	HAN	Their bases are very well hidden. All the power of the Empire can't find them... Do you know where they are?
m529	BEN	We have to find he rebels... What we're carrying belongs to them.
m529	HAN	Well I've brought you here.  What now?
m529	BEN	Well now you know... The enemy is on the move.  We haven't much time.
m529	HAN	The planet has been totally blown away!  It would have taken a thousand ships with a lot more fire power than I've ever seen... If the Empire had a new weapon that could do this... I would have heard something... I'd know about it.
m529	BEN	The Empire must have gotten here first.
m529	HAN	You might get your stuff together. We'll be coming up on Organa Major soon.
m529	BEN	Well we'll see...
m529	BEN	I'm Ben Kenobi.  Luke Starkiller here is leading our expedition.
m529	HAN	I'm Han Solo Captain of this vessel.  Who's in charge then?
m529	BEN	Keep it with you always.  You'll have more need of it than I.  It will bring the Force to you.  You've already learned to feel it... Now you must learn to use it.
m529	LUKE	The Kiber Crystal.
m529	LUKE	I'm not going alone!
m529	BEN	You go after the princess. I am an old man and would be of little help.  I must try to find the Crystal.
m529	LUKE	What about the princess?
m529	LUKE	I don't get it but I guess I did block it.
m529	BEN	See once you let yourself go you can do it.  You'll get it.
m529	BEN	Stop thinking and start feeling. Let yourself go.
m529	LUKE	I can't do it.  I'll get hit.
m529	BEN	Try to feel it.  Use the Force...
m529	LUKE	I can't see!  How can I fight?
m529	BEN	I didn't say that but it appears to be a logical alternative.
m529	LUKE	You mean we should go after her!...
m529	BEN	But she is the only link between us and the hidden bases.
m529	LUKE	He can't find Organa Major.
m529	BEN	What is it?
m529	BEN	All you have to do is lose your thinking self.  Don't focus on anything.  Let your body do your thinking... You have to learn to act on what you feel not what you think ... If I had the crystal it would be much easier.  You could feel the Force immediately... but for now let yourself go.  You'll pick it up... and someday you'll have no need for that pistol either.
m529	LUKE	What do I do?
m529	BEN	I rarely use it any more.  I have the Force.  The Force is more powerful than any pistol.  You shouldn't put too much faith in that weapon.  Work on becoming aware of the Force... learn to feel its presence within you.  Try to sense what it's telling you.  It's the only thing you can rely on.
m529	LUKE	Are you sure you don't need it?
m529	BEN	Yes... the Force... something horrible has happened.  I couldn't see what it was or where it was but it was terrible... terrible beyond description... the cry of millions dying at once.
m529	LUKE	Are you all right?
m529	BEN	Keep away I'm fine I'm fine.
m529	LUKE	What's wrong?  What's happening?
m529	BEN	These are doubtful times.  The Empire has grown bold in its disregard of the...
m529	LUKE	But she's a member of The Twelve Families.  How can they hold her?
m529	BEN	I doubt it.  It would be foolish for the rebel forces to come out of hiding. I know your feelings.  You'd best forget them.  It's for your own good. There will be no saving her from the prisons of Alderaan.  It's the heart of the Sith.  The Bogan Force is the most heavy there.
m529	LUKE	When we get Artoo's message to them you think they'll try to rescue the princess?
m529	BEN	He's bluffing...
m529	LUKE	This is the last place.  Shouldn't we just take what we can get and think of something else?
m529	BEN	Five maybe.  Let me handle it.
m529	LUKE	We don't have that kind of money. How much do you think I can get for the speeder?
m529	BEN	There are two halves of the Force of Others.  One is positive and will help you if you learn how to use it.  But the others half will kill you if you aren't careful.  This negative side of the Force is called the Bogan which is where the expression came from and it is the part that is used by the Dark Lords to destroy their opponents.  Both halves are always present.  The Force is on your right the Bogan is on your left.  The Kiber Crystal can amplify either one.  The Crystal Darth stole was the last one in the possession of the Jedi.  When he joined the Sith the power of the Dark Lords was completed.
m529	LUKE	Like Bogan weather or bogan times. I thought that was just a saying.
m529	BEN	They use the Bogan Force.
m529	LUKE	Do the Sith know the ways of the Force?
m529	BEN	Yes.  It was a black day.  One of my disciple's took the crystal and became a Sith Lord.  It was a black day.  The few crystals that remain are in the possession of the Sith Lords on Alderaan.  That's how they've become so powerful.
m529	LUKE	That's where my father was killed.
m529	BEN	I had one but it was taken at the battle of Condawn...
m529	LUKE	Don't you have a Kiber crystal?
m529	BEN	When a creature dies the force it generated remains.  The Force is all around us.  It can be collected and transmitted through the use of a Kiber crystal.  It's the only way to amplify the power of the Force within you.
m529	LUKE	How can you store an energy field within you?
m529	BEN	A Jedi's power is measured by the amount of the Force that is stored within him and I have little of the Force left in me.
m529	LUKE	But you're still a powerful Jedi. You don't need my help.
m529	BEN	Luke I'm coming along to do what I can but I'm tired and I'm depending on you to get us through.
m529	BEN	It means you'd better get some rest. We'll be leaving for Mos Eisley first thing in the morning.  The trip will be difficult and dangerous but it's the only spaceport with ships large enough to get us to Organa Major.  Now go on!
m529	LUKE	What do you mean?
m529	BEN	That is not a human decision not your or mine.
m529	LUKE	Could I learn to feel it?
m529	BEN	It surrounds you and radiates from you.  A Jedi can feel it flowing from him...  ... from here!
m529	LUKE	You mean I generate an energy field?
m529	BEN	Let's just say the Force is something a Jedi Warrior deals with.  It is an energy field in oneself a power that controls ones acts yet obeys ones commands.  It is nothing yet it makes marvels appear before your very eyes. All living things generate this Force field even you.
m529	LUKE	My father used to talk about the Force of Others.  But he never told me what it was...
m529	BEN	You were right.  It is my responsibility.  The Force of Others brought the message to you and then it brought you to me.
m529	BEN	Not any more!
m529	LUKE	But the Sith Lords are involved! Whatever information this R-2 unit is carrying it must be awfully important.  They're probably looking for him... I'm no match for the Sith. This is a Jedi's work.  This is your responsibility!
m529	BEN	I already know you think you're worthless.  I recommend you learn to think of yourself in a better light for what you believe you are is what you become.  I haven't been involved in anything like this for many years.
m529	LUKE	But you must!  I can't do it alone. I'm not at all like my father.  I'd never make it.
m529	BEN	I'm afraid I've gotten too old for this sort of thing.
m529	LUKE	My father told me many stories about you.  He said if I was ever in trouble to come here... I need your help.
m529	BEN	I know your intentions.  I probably know much more about you than you realize.  In many ways you're a lot like your father.  He was an indulgent man but a clever warrior.  Now what brings you out here?
m529	LUKE	I assure you my intentions weren't bad.
m529	BEN	You could put it that way.
m529	LUKE	You saw through me?
m529	BEN	I know that.
m529	LUKE	I... I'm not a Bendu Officer.  I'm not even a startrooper.
m529	LUKE	But you are... I know your 'Diary of the Clone Wars' by heart.  My father...
m529	BEN	I know who you are.  Stand up so that we can talk properly.  You're embarrassing me.  I'm not that important.
m529	LUKE	I am the son of Annikin Starkiller.
m529	BEN	I don't see why.  I don't believe we've ever met.
m529	BEN	I'm afraid it's been a long time since the White Legions roamed the stars.  But I have the memories.
m529	LUKE	You're General Kenobi?!?  The Jedi knight!  The commander of the White Legions?
m529	BEN	You might say I'm part of the landscape here.  They call me Ben Kenobi.
m529	LUKE	Who are you anyway?
m529	LUKE	Of course.  I'm a Bendu officer.
m529	BEN	Oh so you're a warrior then?
m529	LUKE	I'm Luke Starkiller guardian of the Bendu.
m529	BEN	You're lucky those Tuskens didn't boil you before they hung you out to dry.  They're not the friendly sort. You'd best be moving on before they come back.
m529	LUKE	Couldn't we have tried to think of something else first!
m529	BEN	Sorry but that was the only way to get you down.
m529	BEN	All of them altogether. You seem to have gotten yourself into a fine mess!  What happened?
m529	LUKE	What do you mean 'good morning'? Do you mean that it is a good morning for you or do you wish me a good morning although it is obvious I'm not having one or do you find that mornings in general are good?
m529	BEN	Good morning!
m529	BIGGS	Just be warned that things aren't always as they seem... especially the starforce recruiting posters.
m529	LUKE	At least you're doing something... I'd give anything to be in your position.
m529	BIGGS	The academy is fantastic... Of course they won't teach you anything about flying you don't already know.  Most of the instructors are very conservative pilots.  You can fly circles around them... but there is a lot on the scientific side that is down-right amazing and you get a lot of discipline... but after you graduate don't join the star force -- go free-lance.  It's the only way to get into the action... I can't wait until my hitch is up.
m529	LUKE	But you always said things were so great at the academy... What happened?
m529	BIGGS	I'll tell you Luke and this is between you and me.  The star force isn't all it's cracked up to be. Frankly it's a bore and it's going to stay that way as long as this system is neutral...
m529	LUKE	But there was a lot of firing earlier...
m529	BIGGS	That's no battle kid... They're just sitting there!
m529	LUKE	You look great!  The uniform and everything!
m529	BIGGS	Of course where you been kid?
m529	BLUE LEADER	Forget it son.
m529	LUKE	Yes sir but I can get him...
m529	BLUE LEADER	Blue Five break off your cover attack.  It's too late.  Make your own run on the exhaust port.  Do you copy Luke?
m529	BLUE LEADER	What's that?
m529	LUKE	I'm right behind you Blue Leader.
m529	LUKE	I've got it blocked.  I'm all right.
m529	BLUE LEADER	Blue Five does that glare bother you?
m529	LUKE	Yes sir.
m529	BLUE LEADER	Six hours huh?  Well that's your ship there.  You're blue five.  You stay glued to me.  I don't want any independent operations out there. Personally I think it's foolish for them to be sending fresh kids out on a job like this.  This is no joy ride we're going on.
m529	LUKE	Yes sir.  I was considered one of the best bush pilots on Sullust. I've also had six hours on the T-2.
m529	BLUE LEADER	Have you been checked out?
m529	LUKE	Yes sir.
m529	BLUE LEADER	You're Starkiller?
m529	CONTROLLER	Send out a boarding party.  Full assault gear.
m529	COMMANDER	We don't get many visitors.  Let's take a look at it.
m529	COMMANDER	Send one squad up.
m529	CONTROLLER	As close as we can make out it appears to be a Corellian gypsy vessel... It's not under power.
m529	COMMANDER	I'll make a report later.
m529	CONTROLLER	Should we alert the Sith Lords?
m529	COMMANDER	Alert squad five but hold them until we know what it is.
m529	CONTROLLER	No reply on any circuits... It's drifting on a point twenty-seven skew.  It's not close enough to identify.
m529	LEIA	I have little time for your mercenary concerns but I am grateful for the service you have given to our cause.  What is your price?
m529	HAN	What about us?  Are we to wait forever?  Is our reward to be blown to bits on this forsaken system while your fleet mounts some suicidal attack on that Death Star? Part of my reward is that I be around to spend it.
m529	HAN	I'd like to get paid before that eventually.  I don't plan to stick around for the fireworks.
m529	LEIA	We must hurry to the base.  We have little time before the Death Star arrives.
m529	LEIA	Did it occur to you they might find us?
m529	HAN	I don't see how we're going to find anything out here.  This terrain is hopeless.
m529	HAN	I'd better go see how he's doing.
m529	LEIA	The fourth moon of Yavin.  I've given the coordinates to Chewbacca.
m529	HAN	Where are you taking us now anyway?
m529	LEIA	We captured the plans in a raid on the Imperial shipyards but we fell under attack before I could get the data to safety so I hid it in this Artoo unit and sent him off.
m529	LEIA	The plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system... Our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness which we will determine from the data I stored in Artoo.
m529	HAN	What's that little 'droid' carrying that's so blasted important?
m529	LEIA	When Artoo has been safely delivered to my forces you get your reward. You have my guarantee.
m529	HAN	Then I think we're due the reward you offered... and it had better be substantial after what we've been through.
m529	LEIA	All the data banks in Artoo are still secure.
m529	HAN	Chewbacca it's time we showed them this isn't the regulation F8-88 Cargo Trawler.
m529	LEIA	There are only three or four left.
m529	HAN	Was this trip really necessary?
m529	LEIA	Here come six more... grid two!
m529	LEIA	It could be worse...
m529	HAN	Yes your highness. I'll let you open it then.  It won't be too long before they figure out what happened to us.  This has turned into a brilliant escape!
m529	LEIA	Put that thing away or you're going to get us all killed.
m529	LUKE	Thanks old buddy.  I'll be with you in a second.
m529	HAN	I noticed you were having some problems Blue Five... I thought I'd help.
m529	HAN	I know but the chances for survival here just aren't great enough in my book.  I've got what I came for. Now I've got to get back to my ship.
m529	LUKE	You're a good pilot... I've learned a lot from you... I wish you...
m529	HAN	Well if it's not we'll be facing that Death Star all by our lonesome.
m529	LUKE	They must be shielded somehow.  I'm sure the base is there.
m529	HAN	I don't pick up any life form concentration down there.  She'd better be right.
m529	LUKE	Come back here... Where are you going?
m529	HAN	Get to the ship!
m529	HAN	Move out of the way!
m529	LUKE	It's only light that doesn't affect it.  Solid things like rocks can hurt it!  Fire above him!
m529	LUKE	Get Chewbacca.  Try to get around it. I'll draw it away.
m529	HAN	Watch it!  Move back.
m529	HAN	No he smells something... but we haven't time to worry about it now.
m529	LUKE	Is he afraid of the water?
m529	HAN	Not if this tunnel deadends.
m529	LUKE	I think she's going to be all right.
m529	LUKE	See Threepio come in See Threepio. I wonder where they are??  See Threepio...
m529	HAN	Let's try this way!  Holy Maker.
m529	LUKE	Something has happened to them. Let's try this way...
m529	HAN	I think I did.
m529	LUKE	Why didn't you say so before.
m529	HAN	This isn't going to work.
m529	HAN	Good!  I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.
m529	LUKE	Between his howling and your blasting everything in sight the entire city is going to know we're here.
m529	LUKE	I don't know... I've never fought anyone.
m529	HAN	You're good with 'remotes' but how are you against something living?
m529	LUKE	Well I practice a lot...
m529	HAN	Don't you believe it.
m529	LUKE	Maybe the fact that no one would go there voluntarily could help us. They probably don't think anyone would dare try.
m529	HAN	No it's impossible... No one and I mean no one would venture anywhere near the Alderaan system... I'm a free booter not revolutionary.  You're aboard the wrong ship son!
m529	HAN	All right all right! You've got a ship!  But where do we go from here?  They probably took her to find the hidden bases... I don't see how we can find the rebels before she breaks.  The Empire has already beat us out.
m529	LUKE	Maybe you should just drop us off. I'm sure we can find someone willing to take the risk.
m529	HAN	Why?
m529	LUKE	You can't!  We've come this far.  We must find them...
m529	LUKE	What are you saying?
m529	HAN	I found it... It's just not there.
m529	HAN	Sorcery!  I believe in myself... I determine my destiny not some mystical energy field.
m529	LUKE	You don't believe in the Force?
m529	HAN	I'd keep that thing close just in case if I were you... I've been around from one end of the galaxy to the other and believe me this Force of Others stuff may make for good religion but there is no substitute for a good weapon at your side.
m529	HAN	It's automatic.
m529	LUKE	Who's the pilot?
m529	LUKE	We have a little business to take care of first but it shouldn't take long. We'll be back shortly.
m529	HAN	You got yourself a ship.  We can leave as soon as you're ready.
m529	LUKE	That's pretty steep.  We'd like to talk it over first.
m529	HAN	Organa Major is a rebel system. There will be quite a few starfleet patrols between here and there... It could be a little tricky if you want to avoid them... ten thousand.
m529	INTERCOM VOICE	Who is this?  What's your operating...
m529	LUKE	The... ah door's jammed.  Give us a few minutes to get it fixed.
m529	INTERCOM VOICE	With four casualties?!
m529	LUKE	No need everything's under control.
m529	INTERCOM VOICE	We'll send a squad up.
m529	LUKE	A Wookiee broke loose up here but we've subdued him... There is a lot of damage and three no four casualties...
m529	VADER	It would be much easier if you were to tell us where the outposts are... Otherwise we'll be forced to destroy every suspicious system... What a waste...
m529	LEIA	No!...
m529	VADER	It's too late... We already tested it on Organa Major.  It appears your data never got through.
m529	LEIA	They'll find its weakness.
m529	VADER	The 'Death Star' has become operational.  There is no force in the universe that can stop us now.
m529	VADER	It appears your ship had an accident. I will see to it that your death is duely reported.  There will be no one to save you this time.
m529	LEIA	You'll get no information from me. You have no authority... the council can't hold me!
m529	VADER	Enough!  I already know about the data you've intercepted but its' too late.  Whatever information you've gathered will be destroyed... You will come to know such suffering as only the Master of the Bogan Force can provide...
m529	LEIA	If you're as good a pilot as you are a swordsman... We're the ones who have been rewarded.
m529	LUKE	I... I don't know.  I guess I never thought about it... I just want to help.  I want to be in on the attack. I want my own ship.
m529	LEIA	And you?
m529	LEIA	He'll be well cared for.
m529	LUKE	Are there medical facilities on Yavin?
m529	LEIA	There'll be time for that later. Now let's get out of here.
m529	LUKE	I am Luke Starkiller at your service.
m529	LUKE	You're safe.  We've come to get you out of here... Just relax.
m529	LEIA	What is it?  What's going on?  Where are we?
m529	OWEN	Your father's dead.  Don't ever forget who's taking care of you giving you food giving you shelter and giving you the allowance in the first place. If you plan to work at the academy the way you work around here you won't last very long.  I don't want another word.  Finish your dinner then finish cleaning those 'droids.'
m529	LUKE	You used my savings!  You stole my savings.  If my father were here...
m529	OWEN	I said we'd see.  And as it is I was forced to borrow your academy savings to buy the new 'droids.'  When you've saved it up again I'll let you go.
m529	LUKE	But you promised!  I've saved enough money and now you have the extra help ... you promised!
m529	OWEN	You'll check the condensing unit first... and you're not going to bed until those 'droids' are completely cleaned up...
m529	LUKE	I will but I'll have enough time to transmit my application first.
m529	OWEN	First thing tomorrow morning you're going to check those condensing units on the south ridge.
m529	LUKE	I'd consider it an honor.
m529	THREEPIO	Thank you sir.  Your kindness is greatly appreciated but if it's at all possible Artoo and I would like to remain in your service.
m529	LUKE	Threepio!  Shut down all garbage mashers on your level... Do you copy?? Threepio shut down all garbage...
m529	THREEPIO	Are you there sir?  We're going...
m529	LUKE	Holy Maker Threepio.  I forgot...
m529	LUKE	See Threepio!  Do you copy?
m529	THREEPIO	Wait a minute slow down!... That's better.  They're where?  They what? They are?  Oh no! We're going to be mashed into conduit before this is over...
m529	LUKE	Good.  We're right above you.  Stand by.
m529	THREEPIO	For the moment.  We're in the main hangar.  Artoo is trying to plug into the system now.
m529	LUKE	Are you safe?
m529	THREEPIO	I'm afraid we're not plugged in at the moment sir.  We've had some problems.
m529	LUKE	You're back.  What happened?  Never mind.  What's going on?
m529	THREEPIO	I read you sir.
m529	LUKE	See Threepio... do you copy?
m529	LUKE	Send feed-back into the control sensors in that Detention block.
m529	THREEPIO	Level five Detention block A-23 cell 2187.  She's still alive...
m529	THREEPIO	I know sir but it's the principle of the thing.
m529	LUKE	Let him have it.  You're winning anyway.  It doesn't make any difference.
m529	LUKE	Well ask him.  Tell him we need five thousand.
m529	THREEPIO	Sir I have a couple of extra circuits.  Perhaps they might bring something.
m529	LUKE	I think we're going to need them. Blast it!
m529	LUKE	No you're not.  What kind of talk is that...
m529	THREEPIO	I can't make it.  You go on master Luke.  It doesn't make sense for you to risk yourself on my account.  I'm done for.
m529	LUKE	Can you stand?  We've got to get out of here before those Tuskens come back.
m529	THREEPIO	What happened?  I'm sorry sir I must have taken a bad step...
m529	LUKE	Well I don't know what to do now. We'll just have to head inland and see if we can't find a settlement.
m529	THREEPIO	If you don't mind my saying so sir I don't see how anyone could live in this forsaken place.
m529	LUKE	According to my father's tapes this is the spot where General Kenobi lives but the instruments just don't match up with the landscape... There is no doubt about it we're lost...
m529	THREEPIO	Several I think.  There is not much to tell.  I'm not much more than an interpreter and not very good at telling stories not at making them interesting anyway...
m529	LUKE	Tell me where you've been.  I am going to become a startrooper and fight in the wars.  My father was a Jedi!  Were you in many battles?
m529	THREEPIO	That's how we came to be in your service if you take my meaning...
m529	LUKE	You've been in the Counter Wars?... Against the Empire?
m529	THREEPIO	Indeed sir sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good shape as we are what with the rebellion and all...
m529	LUKE	There's a lot of carbon scoring here. It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action...
m529	THREEPIO	Thank you sir.  I'm See Threepio Human Cyborg relations and this is my counterpart Artoo Detoo.
m529	LUKE	That's all right.  There is nothing anyone can do about it.  You can call me Luke.
m529	THREEPIO	I'm sorry sir I'm only a 'droid' and not very knowledgeable of such things... not on this system anyway. As a matter of fact I'm not even sure which system we're on.
m529	LUKE	Not unless you could get me into the military academy at Anchorhead.
m544	LUTHOR	Not you.  You.  Tell me again.
m544	ALBERT	Me?
m544	LUTHOR	Got it? Otis?
m544	ALBERT	Yes Mr. Luthor. The XK101 can travel anywhere in the world undetected. It also has a sensory device built into it so that it can detect any obstacle in its path and avoid it. It just goes around it or over it.  The XK101 never quits! It will not stop until it reaches its pre-targeted target!
m544	LUTHOR	One of them should've been you.
m544	ALBERT	Yes so well Werner would've gotten to that too but  --  --  but the XK101 flies only eight feet above the ground...well below the radar limit!  So what? We could have done that soon. We had ways to make people ta-- ways to avoid the radar. And this XK101  -- they think it's so smart that they keep it in 'missile silos' underground. Hah!  We kept many things underground.
m544	ALBERT	--  thought about a rocket that carries a nuclear warhead in its nosecone and can strike with an impact of  --
m544	LUTHOR	Albert!
m544	ALBERT	It's very simple Otis.  Very simple the XK101 rocket. It's nothing forty years ago we in the Fatherland were working on this. Five more years we would've had it. But then  --  --  that silly war...Why my cousin Werner had already  --
m544	LUTHOR	And stop interrupting. his is the big scene.  Your finest hour! You rose to the challenge baby! And you lost. That's the best part!
m544	ALBERT	But Mr. Luthor sir I already  --
m544	ALBERT	We're running out of smoke.
m544	LUTHOR	Ah! The guest of honor at last! And about time too!
m544	LUTHOR	Otherwise you're a Mongoloid idiot.  It's reasonable to assume that fragments of the planet were shot out into space by the force of the explosion and  --
m544	ALBERT	Thank you.
m544	LUTHOR	You're a great architect Albert.
m544	ALBERT	He's thirty-five years old.
m544	LUTHOR	That the planet blew up on May 23 1937. That the rocket ship with the revolting little freak in it took three years to reach Earth. Ergo?
m544	LUTHOR	Shut up apple-polisher.
m544	ALBERT	Nobody else.
m544	LUTHOR	Ahhhh my favorite part of the day. Who else could have thought of this aquarium?
m544	LUTHOR	Wonderful. Otis will go above and steal some Big Macs.
m544	ALBERT	There's some slice American cheese...and...a half a bottle of club soda I think.
m544	LUTHOR	I take the man out of Argentina - and it was no picnic finding him y'know? And what does he think about? Bunkers. Still living in the past when I am about to realize the greatest real estate scheme in the history of the world!
m544	ALBERT	Bunkers!
m544	LUTHOR	You'll be designing monuments soon Albert! Hotels! Palaces!
m544	LUTHOR	Stop saying you know when I say 'y'know.' I know you know.  Yes I know you're here Otis. What do you want a brass band?
m544	ALBERT	I know but  --
m544	JIMMY	It's for that piece she's doing on women and competition. She's off to the Women's Western Golf Classic.
m544	CLARK	What's she doing in California?
m544	JIMMY	She's in California. That's wild enough I guess.
m544	CLARK	Lois isn't here?
m544	JIMMY	You and Lois you get all the action.  There she is out in the wild West and everything.
m544	CLARK	It was hot yes.
m544	JIMMY	A hot story huh?
m544	CLARK	I've been on the job.
m544	JIMMY	You'd better get a new alarm clock. The chief has been hollering for you.
m544	CLARK	I will.
m544	MARTHA	Keep warm now.
m544	CLARK	North. It's north
m544	MARTHA	Do you know where you're headed?
m544	MARTHA	I know son I know...
m544	CLARK	Mother...
m544	MARTHA	He's a good man Ben is. Your father always said so.
m544	CLARK	I talked to Ben Hubbard this morning. He'll be more than glad to bring in the crops on shares.
m544	MARTHA	I know.
m544	CLARK	Mom...
m544	MARTHA	Anyway we Kent's don't like showoffs ain't that so? A body's got to be humble even if he knows that he's better'n his neighbors.
m544	CLARK	Don't worry Mom. I know.
m544	MARTHA	I know you're a good boy Clark. No mother could ask for better. It's just that...
m544	CLARK	No Mom. You know I wouldn't break my promise.
m544	MARTHA	Clark...Son...that...thing you did with the Sheriff today... those...stunts...you don't do those things at school do you?
m544	LOIS	Yes but I'm the only one who knows him. I  --  I really like the guy. And he likes me.  I think. I mean I could talk to him you know? And he could talk to me.  Anytime...
m544	CLARK	You're not the only one.
m544	LOIS	Oh what a chance! If I could just  --  get to him.
m544	CLARK	No thanks.
m544	LOIS	It isn't that I still don't like you Clark. It's just that...well once you've had something like that happen to you it kind of changes a girl.  I'm going to make some coffee. You want some?
m544	CLARK	Super...man. Hmmm...
m544	LOIS	They will once I hang it on him in tomorrow's edition.
m544	CLARK	Is that what they're calling him?
m544	LOIS	Superman.  Pretty good name for him isn't it?
m544	CLARK	What'd you call him?
m544	LOIS	Of this...Superman.
m544	CLARK	Jealous? Of what?
m544	LOIS	You're just jealous.
m544	CLARK	I don't know Lois but I do know a fraud when I hear one. This thing goes against all natural laws.
m544	LOIS	Why would he do that? How would he know I was going to suddenly slip.
m544	CLARK	Look there was probably a trampoline on the roof somewhere and this joker just took a big bounce.
m544	LOIS	He grabbed me! He held me! He set me down gently! How could that be done with mirrors?
m544	CLARK	Mirrors then. It's done with mirrors.
m544	LOIS	There weren't any wires. I looked.
m544	CLARK	It was done with wires. They must have rigged him like they do with Peter Pan.
m544	LOIS	Clark Kent if you had only seen it the way I did you -
m544	CLARK	Oh sure. A man flies in the sky like a pigeon and it wasn't a trick.
m544	LOIS	It wasn't a trick!
m544	CLARK	You were probably so scared you didn't look to see what the trick was.
m544	LOIS	I'm telling you I was there.
m544	CLARK	Come again?
m544	LOIS	Not unless you can fly.
m544	CLARK	Can I take you to the airport?
m544	CLARK	Lois you should see what the inside of your lungs look like.
m544	LOIS	There's no real proof that tobacco  --
m544	CLARK	No. I'm just thinking that you smoke too much if you don't mind my saying so.
m544	LOIS	For what? Oh I've see the way the other half lives. My sister for instance. it looks terrific but is that what I really want? Three kids two cats and fifteen needlepoint pillows? I'd go bananas after one week. Hell I need this crazy existence of mine.  Like I need the plague right? That's what your thinking.
m544	CLARK	Don't you ever give up?
m544	LOIS	It's not what you think. Darn it. I'm going out on a story. The Secretary of Defense is landing at the airport tonight and this kid's going to be there to make sure he answers a few questions he'd rather duck.
m544	CLARK	Oh.
m544	LOIS	Thanks Clark but I'm booked for the night.
m544	CLARK	Oh not really. I guess I'll just watch a little TV and --  --  unless...would you be interested in dinner?
m544	LOIS	Big night coming up?
m544	CLARK	Huh?
m544	LOIS	What now my love?
m544	CLARK	I just took a shot at it.
m544	LOIS	You described the exact contents of my purse.
m544	CLARK	Know what?
m544	CLARK	Supposing that man had hurt you? Is it worth risking your life over ten dollars two credit cards and a lipstick? I mean it's not as if --
m544	LOIS	You're great with the advice Clark. Maybe you'd better take over the lovelorn column.
m544	CLARK	It isn't worth getting a heart attack over Lois.
m544	LOIS	Oh for God's sake!
m544	CLARK	He may have a gun!
m544	LOIS	Stop him Clark!
m544	CLARK	What the  --  !
m544	LOIS	Hey!
m544	LOIS	Not in Metropolis it isn't. This is the home of the sneak attack the stab in the back the --
m544	CLARK	Unbelievable.
m544	LOIS	See? Didn't I tell you this was a tough town?
m544	LOIS	'Swell.' When  was the last time I heard anybody say  -  where are you from  anyway?
m544	CLARK	But otherwise it's swell.
m544	LOIS	Some people aren't the athletic type.
m544	CLARK	I think I lost a week's salary at the dart board.
m544	LOIS	Well how are you enjoying your first day on the job?
m544	CLARK	Not really no.
m544	LOIS	Are there any more at home like you?
m544	CLARK	Not really no.
m544	LOIS	Not...gray.
m544	CLARK	Actually she's silver-haired.
m544	LOIS	I know. He sends a check every week to his dear gray-haired old mother.
m544	CLARK	No.
m544	LOIS	Your bookie?
m544	LOIS	Hey you're getting a better class of people in your office these days Boss.
m544	CLARK	I'll bet you have some good ideas.
m544	LOIS	Well!
m544	CLARK	I'd like to.
m544	SUPERMAN	Okay.  Take me to your leader.
m544	EVE	What can I tell you? He's my leader.
m544	SUPERMAN	Look lady you saved my life once. I owe you a favor. But I can't understand why you follow a man like that.
m544	EVE	Oh.
m544	SUPERMAN	Sure and let the plane crash in the middle of the city.
m544	EVE	Couldn't we forget the plane? You could lift me in your big strong arms?
m544	SUPERMAN	I'd better get you down.
m544	EVE	The way you describe him doesn't really do him justice.
m544	SUPERMAN	The bald man! The one who tried to kill me?
m544	EVE	He wants to see you. Lex Luthor.
m544	SUPERMAN	Besides that.
m544	EVE	Screaming
m544	SUPERMAN	What are you doing here?
m544	EVE	Help! I mean  --  I can't stop saying it. Silly isn't it  -  There's nothing to worry about. Help! See.
m544	SUPERMAN	You! The girl from the volcano!  Kryptonite...
m544	EVE	You too.  I just...I can't get it on for good guys. Y'know?
m544	SUPERMAN	Listen...thank you.
m544	LUTHOR	Of course I can. I love you.
m544	EVE	You can't do this to me!
m544	LUTHOR	What other one?
m544	EVE	I mean the other one!
m544	LUTHOR	I'm wearing it.
m544	EVE	Good. Fine. Now where's my parachute?
m544	LUTHOR	Miss Teschmacher Superman is a fairly bright individual. My understanding of the way he works is that he won't be fooled by a simple trick.
m544	EVE	Where's mine?! Where's my parachute?
m544	LUTHOR	Lex is going bye-bye.
m544	EVE	Danger??  Somebody??? Lex  -- where are you going?
m544	LUTHOR	He always shows up when somebody's in danger.
m544	EVE	What if he doesn't show up? What if he's taking a nap?
m544	LUTHOR	You got wax in your ears?
m544	EVE	Tea?
m544	LUTHOR	Nothing nothing. I just want to invite him to tea.
m544	EVE	What are you going to do to him?
m544	LUTHOR	Not exactly. But it's his kind of neighborhood.
m544	EVE	Oh. Why? does he live up here?
m544	EVE	I didn't bring any  --
m544	LUTHOR	Your volcano chum? Your junior life-saving buddy?  Let's get high.
m544	EVE	This all has something to do with Superman doesn't it?
m544	LUTHOR	Yours not to reason why Miss Teschmacher. Relax! Enjoy it!  Just look at that smog!
m544	EVE	I don't understand.
m544	LUTHOR	Baby -- I'm going to take you higher.
m544	EVE	A night on the town instead of under it?
m544	LUTHOR	She knows. Clever very clever.  And unappreciated. But I'm going to take you away from all this.
m544	EVE	I know...
m544	LUTHOR	You've been under such a strain. And I've ...I've --  -- neglected you. Mea culpa! Y'know.
m544	EVE	I knew you'd hit me.
m544	LUTHOR	Hit you? A clever girl like you?  'He turned slowly slowly in the lava...' was how you described it. Now that's clever.  I have to hand it to you.
m544	EVE	You're not going to hit me?
m544	LUTHOR	Something you can feed the pets perhaps?  Let's have it.
m544	EVE	There was a recipe on the back  --
m544	LUTHOR	No news is not good news. Y'know
m544	LUTHOR	You have two minutes and thirty- two seconds.
m544	EVE	You?! How about me?
m544	LUTHOR	Don't let me down.
m544	LUTHOR	Nothing.
m544	EVE	But if I put my leg out like Claudette Clobert in  --
m544	LUTHOR	They stop for nothing.
m544	EVE	Ready.
m544	LUTHOR	Ready?
m544	LUTHOR	Is that an innuendo Miss Teschmacher? Because if it is you are about to experience the heady thrill of being hurled from a moving vehicle.
m544	EVE	You ever try to run in high heels?  You probably did.
m544	LUTHOR	Weak sister.  I still can't figure out why it took so long for you to catch up with us after we all ran out. Y'know?
m544	EVE	I don't like to talk about it Lex.
m544	LUTHOR	About Vesuvius. About Superman writhing in the bowels of the volcano.  Ahh the look on his face when he saw that Kryptonite. When will I see another y'know? Y'know?
m544	EVE	The least we can do is leave him another door jam.
m544	LUTHOR	What do you suggest my dear?
m544	EVE	We just take it?
m544	LUTHOR	The door jam Miss Teschmacher. This Ethiopian shmendrick here in his simple unconscious way needed something to wedge the door open the better to inhale the flies that form such an  important part of his diet. So he grabs something from the table...
m544	EVE	You're not going to tell us why you're happy are you?
m544	LUTHOR	La de da da...
m544	EVE	You're happy aren't you?
m544	EVE	I will as soon as I get the sand out of my nose.
m544	LUTHOR	Breathe that air Miss Teschmacher.
m544	LUTHOR	No you're going to get kissed
m544	EVE	I know I'm going to get rapped in the mouth for saying this but so what?
m544	LUTHOR	Tune me in  lady. An explosion such as the one Superman describes would have altered the molecular structure of the Krypton rock.
m544	EVE	I don't mean to denigrate your misspent youth Lex but what does that rock have to do with --
m544	LUTHOR	"Ahh. 'National Geographic."""" In my day this made 'Playboy"""" look like Mother Goose."
m544	LUTHOR	Bingo!
m544	EVE	Meteorites!
m544	LUTHOR	Deductive reasoning my friends! That's the name of the game. What does it say here?
m544	EVE	Mr. Romance...
m544	LUTHOR	Stay and listen!  Besides it's twelve in the afternoon. This is no time to go to bed.
m544	EVE	I'm going to bed.
m544	LUTHOR	See? I see. It's you who don't see. Doesn't see. I cannot believe it! How you people fail to grasp the long-range significance of this! Y'know?
m544	EVE	See?
m544	LUTHOR	Exactly Miss Teschmacher.
m544	EVE	I read the article.
m544	LUTHOR	Some people can read 'War and Peace' and come away thinking it was a simple adventure story. Other people can read the ingredients on a chewing gum wrapper and come away with the secret of the universe.  Y'know.
m544	EVE	Krypton? The place where Superman comes from?
m544	LUTHOR	Krypton!
m544	LUTHOR	When it gets to seventy-five below stabilize it.
m544	EVE	Fifty degrees below and still falling.
m544	LUTHOR	What's the temperature now?
m544	EVE	Place your bets ladies and gentlemen.
m544	LUTHOR	Damn!  This will get him.
m544	EVE	I didn't say a word.
m544	LUTHOR	Shut up.
m544	LUTHOR	You're on.
m544	EVE	Bet he makes it.
m544	EVE	Tough guy huh?
m544	LUTHOR	Nuts. He made it.
m544	LUTHOR	He's from another world.
m544	EVE	You think he's for real?
m544	LUTHOR	I needed this Y'know? I really needed this. just when I'm nearing the fruition of my project Big Bird flies into town.  Go ahead! Kill me by inches! Put me on the agony rack!
m544	LUTHOR	First the pets Otis.
m544	EVE	Again???
m544	LUTHOR	What about dinner? I have to worry about the crime of the century that's all. Y'know? Am I supposed to worry about what's in the refrigerator too?  What's in it?
m544	EVE	Speaking of feeding things what about dinner?
m544	EVE	Even that would be an improvement.
m544	LUTHOR	You'll be seeing stars in a minute Miss Teschmacher. y'know?
m544	EVE	Streets Sunlight. When was the last time I saw sunlight.
m544	LUTHOR	Criers and complainers! That's what I get! Moaners and groaners! Me Lex Luthor who figured out how to live in luxury without ever paying one cent in taxes. Lex Luthor who built this fantastic kingdom under the sea so to speak hidden and undetected by the fools who eke out their miserable lives on the streets above.
m544	EVE	So I've noticed.
m544	LUTHOR	Compared to what came before? A year of living in the sewers?  A part of that will always be with me.
m544	EVE	This??
m544	LUTHOR	I know that. Bu tin this case he was right. Arnold 'Buster' Luthor the most inept check forger of his time --  A pity he didn't live to see his son strike out for the big city. A pity he didn't live to see how from humble beginnings I created an empire.
m544	EVE	Your father was a sick weirdo.
m544	LUTHOR	"My father always said to me 'Son don't invest your money in anything but land. Land! Stocks rise and fall banks fall people are no damn good but they'll always need land and for that they'll pay through the nose. 'Remember that ' my father said. 'Land."""""
m544	EVE	Why does it all mean so much to you? All the time 'land land land.'
m544	LUTHOR	So it's six hundred feet below Park Avenue It's still a Park Avenue address.
m544	EVE	It isn't a Park Avenue address. really.
m544	LUTHOR	Me and my real estate? How  many other girls Miss Teschmacher are lucky enough to have a Park Avenue address like this?
m544	EVE	You and your real estate.
m544	JOR-EL	Neither my wife nor I will attempt to leave Krypton.
m544	FIRST ELDER	Will you abide by the Council's opinion?
m544	FIRST ELDER	If you persist you leave us no choice.
m544	JOR-EL	As an irredeemable criminal? You compare me to them?
m544	JOR-EL	And if I don't obey?
m544	FIRST ELDER	This discussion is terminated. The decision of the council is final.  You will cease pursuing this matter. Any attempt by you to continue to create a climate of fear and panic among the populace will be deemed an act of insurrection!
m544	JOR-EL	I have sworn to uphold the laws of Krypton.
m544	FIRST ELDER	But so is Vond-El
m544	JOR-EL	Then -
m544	FIRST ELDER	You are one of Krypton's greatest scientists Jor-El -
m544	FIRST ELDER	Jor-El Be warned. This tone of yours approaches insolence.
m544	JOR-EL	But you can't ignore these facts!  It's suicide!  Worse than that it's genocide.
m544	JIMMY	On the salary he pays me I can't make my rent without it.
m544	LOIS	Need I ask who's favored to collect at the end of this week.
m544	LOIS	It's because I'm an intrepid girl reporter Jimmy.  Besides the chief of detectives has the hots for me.
m544	JIMMY	How come you get all the good stories Lois?
m544	LOIS	Gets you where you live huh?
m544	JIMMY	Boy!
m544	LOIS	'And the people on the street the little man who runs the corner newsstand the old lady sunning herself on the stoop the kids playing stick ball -- none of them will ever forget the night of senseless bloodletting that turned a friendly block part into a nightmare.' 
m544	JIMMY	Two.
m544	LOIS	"an Ode to Spring. are there one or two """"T's"""" in bloodletting?"
m544	JIMMY	What're you writing Lois?
m544	MARTHA	I bless the day you came to us son. You know that. But some people wouldn't understand.
m544	JONATHAN	What your mother means Clark is that she don't want folks to think you're special.
m544	MARTHA	Oh dear. That isn't what I --
m544	MARTHA	Don't brag now  Jonathan.
m544	JONATHAN	Got all A's this year. Teacher said he's the best 5th grader in the -
m544	MARTHA	We don't want a child called 'Junior' ain't that so Clark? Why sure it is.
m544	JONATHAN	Who? Clark? I never cared two hoots for that fella.  Jonathan Jr. That's got a ring to it.
m544	MARTHA	I was thinkin' what to call him. I was thinkin' I had an uncle who was a fine man you recall him? The Church Sexton
m544	JONATHAN	Guess I'd better hitch up the rig and come back to get that...that thing he was settin' in. What do you make of that thing? Martha? You listening?
m544	MARTHA	We'll say he's a child to my cousin in North Dakota and just now orphaned.  Poor thing.
m544	JONATHAN	Folks'll ask question.
m544	MARTHA	All these years happy as we've been how I prayed and prayed He'd see fit to give us a child. And just when I finally accepted my bitter lot...  No one must ever know.
m544	JONATHAN	He sure as heck does that.
m544	MARTHA	The good lord works in mysterious ways.
m544	MARTHA	All of us.
m544	JONATHAN	Well - gotta change that tire if were gonna get home.
m544	MARTHA	Don't just stand there gapin' Jonathan. Can't you see he's cold?
m544	JONATHAN	What's your name boy?
m544	MARTHA	It's a ...baby.
m544	JOR-EL	Then you have on of those 'feelings.' It was called: 'love.'
m544	LARA	I want to know what my child is going to face.
m544	JOR-EL	You've been doing some research in the archives.
m544	LARA	He will be odd different.
m544	JOR-EL	Yes true. But on other worlds there would be other problems - heat cold no life no life support systems...No Lara believe me; Earth is the least of evils. On Earth his lighter gravity will render him almost weightless - that can't be helped. But with his denser molecular structure he will also be strong.  He will be fast He will be virtually invulnerable.
m544	LARA	He'll be weightless.
m544	JOR-EL	Their atmosphere will sustain him. He will look like one of them.
m544	LARA	A million years behind us.  Jor-El he's only a baby.
m544	JOR-EL	They are primitive Lara but they are not animals.
m544	LARA	But why Earth Jor-El. They're practically animals.
m544	JOR-EL	Lara please...
m544	LARA	-- as we will be.
m544	JOR-EL	It's the only logical conclusion. If he remains here he'll be as dead as...
m544	JOR-EL	And it is forbidden for you to interfere with human history. All you can do Kal-El even now that you have...found yourself...is help them to evolve. Set an example. Show them they must strive towards the light. And... remember us...
m544	SUPERMAN	There are none of them any good anyway.
m544	JOR-EL	Or twenty-four as it is in Earth time. Furthermore if you will reveal yourself your enemies will have a way of getting at you where you are vulnerable: by hurting the people you care for.  Ah this Earth...this world you live in Kal-El...  Resist its temptations its rewards especially its political system.
m544	SUPERMAN	Twenty-four.
m544	JOR-EL	....to feel yourself. Very well. You are revealed to the world. But still you must keep your secret identity. First of all you will need it as an escape valve. You cannot be special twenty-eight hours a day -
m544	SUPERMAN	How good it felt -
m544	JOR-EL	How good it felt!
m544	SUPERMAN	No! You couldn't imagine -
m544	JOR-EL	My son I foresaw this. I knew -
m544	SUPERMAN	I guess I got carried away
m544	JOR-EL	Enjoyed it?
m544	SUPERMAN	I don't know what to say.  Look I -- I just -
m544	PERRY	Whoever comes up with that will make Woodward and Bernstein look like Abbot and Costello.
m544	LOIS	He is. Usually.
m544	PERRY	If one of you can get that  -- I mean I want the real Superman. Who is he? Where's he from? What's his favorite ball team? What's up?
m544	PERRY	I was going to say that there's only one 'p' in subpoena. What the hell did you major in at Radcliffe? Middle English?  Nice job on the teamster's update Kent.
m544	LOIS	Nine to five it's a Pulitzer Prize I know.
m544	PERRY	Lois the kickback story...
m544	LOIS	Okay but...why?  No offense.
m544	PERRY	Lois take Kent there and introduce him around
m544	PERRY	It does huh?  Clark Kent I'd like you to meet Lois Lane.
m544	LOIS	Here's the story on that East 19th Street murder spree. Page one with a banner headline seems about right to me.
m544	SUPERMAN	Well I was born on a planet your scientists don't know too much about. It's in the Xeno Galaxy. Or it was. It was called Krypton. That's K-R-Y-P...
m544	LOIS	Where do you hail from?
m544	SUPERMAN	Very much.
m544	LOIS	Do you like pink?
m544	SUPERMAN	Sure.
m544	LOIS	Can you actually fly faster than the speed of sound?
m544	SUPERMAN	Pink.
m544	LOIS	What color underwear am I wearing?
m544	SUPERMAN	Only when somebody shoots them at me.
m544	LOIS	Do bullets really bounce off you?
m544	SUPERMAN	Yes. Although I can get a headache just like anyone.
m544	LOIS	Is it true you're impervious to pain?
m544	SUPERMAN	Uh-huh.
m544	LOIS	Can you really see through anything?
m544	SUPERMAN	What about it?
m544	LOIS	What about this X-Ray vision of yours?
m544	SUPERMAN	195 pounds.
m544	LOIS	How much do you weigh?
m544	SUPERMAN	Thirty-five.
m544	LOIS	How old are you?
m544	SUPERMAN	It's not bad.
m544	LOIS	It must feel great.
m544	SUPERMAN	The reason I can fly is because my molecular structure is so constituted that I have a lighter density under Earth's gravitational force.
m544	LOIS	Oh.
m544	SUPERMAN	I wouldn't do that. It's against the law.
m544	LOIS	Well I mean it's not everybody that can deliver an air mail letter without putting a stamp on it.
m544	SUPERMAN	I guess they are a little odd.
m544	LOIS	I didn't mean that in any pejorative way.
m544	SUPERMAN	You think they're strange?
m544	LOIS	Okay. Let's start with these strange powers of yours.
m544	SUPERMAN	Ask You're the girl reporter.
m544	LOIS	Oh.  Well where do we start?
m544	SUPERMAN	I'd appreciate it if you didn't smoke.
m544	LOIS	Oh I've got to get some matches.  My cigarette.
m544	LOIS	Not exactly. He's kind of a rewrite man. Actually he's a bit dull if you know what I mean.
m544	SUPERMAN	Who's Clark? One of your colleagues?
m544	LOIS	If I do you can punish  me. Fly me to Bermuda and just lave me there for two weeks.  This is fantastic! I wish Clark were here.
m544	SUPERMAN	I think you'll be able to remember it. I doubt you'll misquote me.
m544	LOIS	Well...flashlight?
m544	SUPERMAN	Unlisted number Shall we proceed?
m544	LOIS	This is incredible. I was just sitting here trying to figure out how to contact you. I mean you don't have an answering service right?
m544	SUPERMAN	There's been a lot of confusion in the media about who I am and what I'm up to and all that. I'd like to set the record straight. With your help.
m544	LOIS	The answer is yes. Now what's the question?
m544	SUPERMAN	I came to talk to you.
m544	LOIS	Wha'...what are you doing here?
m544	SUPERMAN	Right on the first guess.
m544	LOIS	Superman???
m544	SUPERMAN	Not a chance. It's too nice a night.
m544	LOIS	With my luck now it'll rain.
m544	SUPERMAN	Let's just say I'm a friend.  And watch yourself from now on with those things Okay?  I mean if the good lord wanted people to fly he would have given them wings.
m544	LOIS	Who...who...
m544	SUPERMAN	Not while I'm around you're not. C'mon...
m544	LOIS	Oh God! I'm going to die!
m544	SUPERMAN	Do as I say. Let go!
m544	LOIS	You've got me? Who's got you???
m544	SUPERMAN	Easy now miss I've got you???
m544	LUTHOR	Good enough for you. Now then --  --  tell me something I like to hear. As many times as I hear it...
m544	OTIS	Sort of.
m544	LUTHOR	Ah dear simple Otis. Albert explain it to him.
m544	OTIS	I still don't get it.
m544	OTIS	Oh Mr. Luthor...
m544	LUTHOR	Cleaning a rock Otis?  Jot it down. As soon as we're back he feeds the pets.
m544	OTIS	Maybe it's being polished or something. Maybe they're cleaning it.
m544	LUTHOR	They're killing me by inches!  Go ahead! Make me suffer! Milk me dry.
m544	OTIS	It's a Twinkie boss.
m544	LUTHOR	Well gents? What did I tell you? It's a piece of cake.
m544	LUTHOR	Will kill him! And I'm going to have a piece of the rock! Miss Teschmacher pack your --
m544	OTIS	You mean bullets and fire and all that can't hurt him but this kind of rock --
m544	LUTHOR	But to someone from the planet Krypton this substance would be lethal because of its high level of radioactivity. Kryptonite! Ah Kryptonite! That's the stuff!
m544	LUTHOR	Y'know? I'm sure of it. Y'know? And there's a strong streak of goody- goody in him that is going to blow this deal for me if I don't do something about it.  Something!
m544	OTIS	It is for me.
m544	LUTHOR	Is that real enough for you?
m544	LUTHOR	Otis...
m544	OTIS	Please...
m544	OTIS	I guess I...uh...regressed.
m544	LUTHOR	And now he lies to me. He has been stealing ladies' purses again.  Haven't you? Haven't you you miserable petty crook?
m544	OTIS	I...uh...check.
m544	LUTHOR	I gave him this new face.
m544	OTIS	I'll never forget you for that Mr. Luthor.
m544	LUTHOR	I gave him steady employment --
m544	OTIS	I'll always be grateful Mr. Luthor.
m544	LUTHOR	I broke the man out of prison --
m544	LUTHOR	Otis were you up to your old tricks?
m544	OTIS	Matter? With me? Nothing's the matter.
m544	LUTHOR	What's the matter Otis?
m544	LUTHOR	Excellent Otis.  But what took you so long?
m544	OTIS	Did I do good Mr. Luthor?
m544	LUTHOR	Not there!  A pine tree in Death Valley? Idiot! This is for the North Woods section!
m544	OTIS	There.
m544	OTIS	Yessir. Just what you wanted.
m544	LUTHOR	Now then Otis. Did you get what I asked for?
m544	LUTHOR	No speeches Otis. Just watch what Albert has prepared.  What are you waiting for?
m544	OTIS	I...uh...
m544	SUPERMAN	We'll see how fast I can fly.
m544	LUTHOR	Now who's the dreamer Superman? Even you can't fly that fast!
m544	LUTHOR	For the first time today Superman I must tell you that you're wrong.  But how could you know that -  Oh well. I guess I could tell you now. Y'see actually...but this conversation is becoming rather dry isn't it.
m544	SUPERMAN	Well it's very impressive but you built this junk for nothing.
m544	LUTHOR	In a way  -- oh it'll be a relief. I'm a wreck. No rest for the wicked y'know. It wasn't enough the radio frequencies then I had to worry about getting to the missile and adjusting the aiming. So that if I could have activated the launch  -- well Lex Luthor would've hit the spot.  There's a little place on Route 190. Dead on the practice optimum stress point of the San Andreas Fault. It wouldn't mean much to you Superman but I call it...target zero.  Pancho's Taco Palace...
m544	SUPERMAN	They'll soon be over.
m544	LUTHOR	Well that's their problem T.S. But  --  but the XK 101 also works on a radio wave control system. The problem was to find out the frequency. Problems problems I've had so many...
m544	LUTHOR	You guessed it!  You're always one step ahead of me.  Aren't you Superman?  Yes right. There was a police helicopter buzzing the area and transmitting on the same frequency as the garage doors. The minute the signal went out --  Zip!  Zip!  Zip!
m544	SUPERMAN	Luthor  --
m544	LUTHOR	And garbage doors.
m544	SUPERMAN	On radio waves?
m544	LUTHOR	Still foolishly perhaps I had a theory that eliminates the Presidential push-button.  I was doing my homework...
m544	LUTHOR	I know. I know.  I never promised myself a rose garden.
m544	SUPERMAN	The XK 101. Luthor that operates on radio waves. And with our fail-safe system only the President himself can push that button.
m544	LUTHOR	You're right you're right Superman. There were wrinkles to iron out. But well...  ...there is this new rocket the XK 101.
m544	SUPERMAN	It wouldn't hurt. You can't go on living in fantasies. Did you really think you could get hold of a nuclear bomb? And drop it?  Why our Strategic Defense boys would have  --
m544	LUTHOR	Maybe I should get help.
m544	SUPERMAN	It would never have worked Luthor. You are a dreamer  --  a sick twisted dreamer.
m544	LUTHOR	--  Dropped into the sea!  Bye-bye California! Hello new West Coast! Gold Coast! My Coast.  And now...well...  I left my heart in San Francisco...
m544	SUPERMAN	Nice! Most of California would have been destroyed. Millions of people would've been killed! The West Coast as we know it would have  --
m544	LUTHOR	Couldn't have said it better myself.  Now all this  --  --  west of the Fault is the most expensive real estate in the world. Los Angeles. San Diego. San Francisco. And here  --  --  is just hundreds and hundreds of miles of cheap desert land. Land that happens to be owned by Lex Luthor Enterprises. Well...  ...call me a fool but ...it did occur to me that if a conventional five hundred megaton bomb were to explode at exactly the proper stress point --  --  that would trigger the upheaval that would cause the San Andreas Fault to 'do its thing.'  Ah it would've been so nice y'know...
m544	SUPERMAN	Sure. It's the joining together of two land masses pushed together eight million years ago. The fault line itself is unstable and always shifting which is the reason you get earthquakes in the California area from time to time.
m544	LUTHOR	At the San Andreas Fault. Maybe you've heard of it.
m544	LUTHOR	Right right. Where was I? Ah yes --
m544	SUPERMAN	Of time Luthor.
m544	LUTHOR	It's just that  --  I spent a fortune on these things!  And all for naught! What a waste  --
m544	LUTHOR	No Superman of course not. You do get around don't you.
m544	SUPERMAN	I don't need a geography lesson Luthor.
m544	LUTHOR	This is California. The richest most populous state in America. And growing like a sonofagun.
m544	LUTHOR	Oh that. Listen  --  you're busy  --  and it's a long story --
m544	SUPERMAN	Plenty! About 'The Crime of the Century' Remember?
m544	LUTHOR	Well  --  you've got me! What can I say?
m544	SUPERMAN	But...why?
m544	LUTHOR	Makes Cecil B. DeMille look like the Senior Class play right?
m544	SUPERMAN	What is this??!
m614	STORM	Beast.
m614	BEAST	Storm.  Try to look for the highest vantage point. From what I can figure he'll need to gain as much altitude as possible to blanket the island.  It is my feeling that Magneto has to--
m614	STORM	We all do.
m614	BEAST	I wish I could go.
m614	STORM	... until he found tungsten.
m614	BEAST	Thomas Edison knew how to make the light bulb.  He had the energy source. He had the vacuum.  But he didn't have the filament.  He tried metal after metal but nothing would hold to power.
m614	BEAST	The neuro-filter acts like a surge protector regulating the infinite flow of information from Cerebro to the Professor's mind.  It's what keeps him from being crushed by the consciousness of millions.
m614	STORM	What does that mean?
m614	CYCLOPS	So where do you think he's planning this larger demonstration?
m614	BEAST	Yes -- Only there's a problem.  The mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature.  It's forcing the body's cells to replicate thousands of times faster than they're accustomed to.  The Senator's body is literally burning itself out.  Scott -- this machine kills people and I don't think Magneto realizes it.
m614	CYCLOPS	For what purpose?
m614	BEAST	Correct...  Apparently Adamantium is the only metal strong enough to hold the energy this machine produces.  He used the Adamantium in Logan's dog tag to test it on the Senator.  And I assume now he plans to use the rest of Logan's skeleton for a larger demonstration.
m614	CYCLOPS	Its core?
m614	BEAST	It appears as though Magneto has built a machine which somehow triggers the mutator gene in normal human beings. And he is using Adamantium as its core.
m614	BEAST	I'm afraid without Cerebro's help he won't have the strength to heal himself -- And without the neuro- filter... there's no Cerebro.
m614	CYCLOPS	Can the Professor repair his own mind?
m614	JEAN	I'm sorry.  I'm not strong enough.
m614	CYCLOPS	Jean... can you?
m614	CYCLOPS	Storm Rogue -- you take the south entrance.  Jean and I will go in here.
m614	JEAN	It's too far.
m614	CYCLOPS	I'm going to assume that means that the Secret Service is out of commission.  Jean can you raise me up there?
m614	CYCLOPS	Uh-huh.
m614	JEAN	Into the Hudson?
m614	CYCLOPS	Radar Stealth Mode checks out.  All right there'll be less security north of the George Washington Bridge.  I'm taking her down.
m614	CYCLOPS	He calls me sport one more time and I'll blow a watermelon-sized hole through him.
m614	JEAN	What's that?
m614	CYCLOPS	I'll tell you one thing though.
m614	JEAN	Well I think that's perfectly understandable.
m614	CYCLOPS	Hey.  I'm sorry.  About Logan.  I was jealous.
m614	CYCLOPS	No.  I'm...  I don't know if we can do this without Charles.
m614	JEAN	Are you all right?
m614	CYCLOPS	We have to find Magneto.
m614	JEAN	He's already losing control of his vitals.  Respiratory.  Cardiovascular. Unless we manage to replace the filter by tomorrow morning I'm afraid.
m614	JEAN	His vital signs are weak and getting weaker.
m614	CYCLOPS	What's wrong with him?
m614	JEAN	If Magneto is planning to use Logan for some terrible purpose it's our responsibility to do something.
m614	CYCLOPS	You saw what happened tonight.  You think Magneto won't come after him again.  You think he won't come here if necessary.  This is a school for God's sake.
m614	JEAN	What are you talking about?
m614	CYCLOPS	I don't like him being here.
m614	JEAN	Scott.. I -
m614	CYCLOPS	Sure you are sport.
m614	LOGAN	I'm o.k.  I'm o.k.
m614	LOGAN	Shut up.  I got no interest in you Xavier  or your... X-Men.
m614	CYCLOPS	You know you --
m614	LOGAN	I've served with men like you before. Methodical.  Systematic -- Naive.  You know what happens to those men in a real fight?
m614	LOGAN	I don't remember.  Is that what you wanted to ask me?
m614	CYCLOPS	How long have you been in Alaska?
m614	CYCLOPS	I wanted to talk to you.
m614	LOGAN	Inspiring -- Now what am I doing here?
m614	JEAN	Yeah I'll bet you have.
m614	LOGAN	I've seen a lot of rings.
m614	JEAN	Logan do you see this ring?
m614	JEAN	What is it you're failing to get at? Are you interested in me?
m614	LOGAN	He takes himself seriously.
m614	JEAN	He takes his work seriously.
m614	LOGAN	He's uptight.
m614	LOGAN	Suit yourself.
m614	JEAN	Let go.
m614	JEAN	Not interested.
m614	LOGAN	What do you say?
m614	JEAN	Were you now?
m614	LOGAN	I was thinking maybe you and me could go into town.
m614	JEAN	He's busy right now.
m614	LOGAN	You should always work with a spotter.
m614	LOGAN	What if they're naughty?
m614	JEAN	If necessary.
m614	LOGAN	By reading my thoughts?
m614	JEAN	Maybe the Professor could help you with that.
m614	LOGAN	Yeah?  Well I don't like to talk about my past.
m614	JEAN	The Professor said you were a solider. Actually I believe he used the word mercenary.
m614	LOGAN	What if I like the pain?
m614	JEAN	I'll see what I can do -- You should get some sleep.  Even with your healing ability you're going to be hurting for a while.
m614	LOGAN	I won't light the cigars - how about that?
m614	JEAN	There's no smoking or drinking on the school grounds.
m614	LOGAN	Some cigars.  Case of beer.
m614	JEAN	Anything else I can get you?
m614	KELLY	I can assure you there is no such creature in my genes.
m614	JEAN	The mutant gene tells the body when it needs to change.
m614	KELLY	Tell it to the ones that did this to me.
m614	JEAN	Treat you like a mutant?  We are not what you think.  Not all of us.
m614	KELLY	I'm sorry to come here Ms. Grey.  I was afraid if I went to a hospital they would...
m614	JEAN	Senator?
m614	KELLY	Dr. Grey.
m614	KELLY	I can assure you there is no such creature in my genes.
m614	JEAN	I presume nothing I am here to tell you that in time the mutator gene will activate in every living human being on this planet.  Perhaps even your children Senator.
m614	KELLY	This was taken by a state police officer in Secaucus New Jersey.  A man in a minor altercation literally melted the car in front of him.  I don't know where you come from Ms. Grey but where I come from you don't go melting people's cars when they cut you off.  You do it the old fashioned way -- you give 'em the finger.  But what you presume to tell this committee -
m614	JEAN	Control Senator...  we teach them control.
m614	KELLY	You wouldn't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to --
m614	JEAN	Math.  History.  Science.  English. Athletics --
m614	KELLY	Ms. Grey -- you work at a school for mutants in Westchester New York.  Can you tell the members of this committee what exactly you are teaching these mutants?
m614	JEAN	I am avoiding a question that is decidedly loaded Senator.  The wrong person behind the wheel of a car can be dangerous.
m614	KELLY	You're avoiding the question I posed to you at the beginning of the hearing Ms. Grey.  Three words: Are mutants dangerous?
m614	MAGNETO	Let's just say God works too slowly.
m614	KELLY	What is it you intend to do to me?
m614	MAGNETO	INTENTION?  Intention Senator?  We are talking about mankind here.  His fear.  It is only a matter of time before mutants will be herded into camps.  Studied for weaknesses.  And eventually wiped off the face of the Earth.
m614	KELLY	The intention of registration act -
m614	MAGNETO	Gosh I hope so.
m614	KELLY	Whatever you do to me... no matter what you'll make me right.  Every word I have spoken will be confirmed.
m614	KELLY	You mutant bastards...
m614	MAGNETO	Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator.
m614	KELLY	You... wha... Who are you... Where is Henry?
m614	MAGNETO	In the road to survival there is always sacrifice Logan.  We are the future... not them.  We must protect ourselves.  After tonight when the leaders of the world return home -- They will return as brothers as mutants... and our cause will be theirs.  This is survival I know you understand that Logan... or is it Wolverine?
m614	LOGAN	What are you going to do?
m614	MAGNETO	You're backstage at the encore of creation.
m614	LOGAN	Where am I?
m614	LOGAN	You think I care about her?  I'm the only one who's sure to walk out of here.
m614	MAGNETO	Come with me and I'll let her live.
m614	LOGAN	What do you want?
m614	MAGNETO	I do love a good check mate.
m614	LOGAN	What?... miss me?  Charley I'm gonna walk out the front door and trust me it won't be soon enough for everyone here.
m614	XAVIER	Why?  You have a home here now if you want it.  Everyone will...
m614	LOGAN	Actually I'm feeling up to leaving.
m614	XAVIER	They're all asking how you're doing. Are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone?
m614	LOGAN	Don't you knock?
m614	LOGAN	I'll go.
m614	XAVIER	I've found her Westchester Mall.
m614	XAVIER	We were friends once...  But that was a long time ago.
m614	LOGAN	He helped you?
m614	XAVIER	Actually Magneto helped me put it together.
m614	LOGAN	You designed this yourself?
m614	XAVIER	The brainwaves of mutants are quite different than those of the average human being.
m614	LOGAN	How?
m614	XAVIER	To find Rogue.
m614	LOGAN	Where are we going?
m614	XAVIER	I believe he wants you for your Adamantium.
m614	LOGAN	No.  That's me talking.  And you know what?  It's only been thirty-two hours and you still have no idea what this guy wants with me.
m614	XAVIER	Now that's Magneto talking.
m614	LOGAN	What if it never happens?  What if they're so afraid of us that we become the enemy? -- This place is gonna be one giant cemetery.
m614	XAVIER	The point is to step into a more evolved position of social responsibility.  To recognize that there is a world out there and that we mutants are as much a part of it as normal human beings.
m614	LOGAN	"This.  This whole God damn thing.  Making yourselves into some sort of """"team"""" of super-powered freaks. Teaching wayward mutants about classical literature.  For what?"
m614	XAVIER	The point of what?
m614	XAVIER	Deal.
m614	LOGAN	Forty-eight hours old man.  But if you cross me I won't feel any guilt about what I do to you.
m614	XAVIER	A very powerful mutant who for some reason has taken an interest in you. I'm not sure why but until we find out I must ask you to stay.
m614	LOGAN	Who?
m614	XAVIER	I brought you here so that you would be safe from Magneto.
m614	LOGAN	What am I doing here?
m614	LOGAN	And you think it helps calling her Rogue?
m614	STORM	If she held on any longer she could have.
m614	LOGAN	I felt like she almost killed me.
m614	STORM	She borrowed your power to save her life.  When she touches someone she absorbs their strengths -- their gifts.  In your case -- your ability to heal.  That's why she keeps her body covered.
m614	LOGAN	What did she do to me?
m614	STORM	The sun is setting Logan.  You've been asleep for nineteen hours.
m614	LOGAN	Why is everybody up at sunrise?
m614	MAGNETO	ALIVE.
m614	SABRETOOTH	I'll find him.
m614	MAGNETO	Enough for a test.
m614	SABRETOOTH	Is it enough?
m614	MAGNETO	A piece.  Only a piece.
m614	SABRETOOTH	Is that what you're looking for?
m614	SABRETOOTH	It was Xavier's people.  They knew.
m614	MAGNETO	How?
m614	SABRETOOTH	I lost him.
m614	XAVIER	I feel a great swell of pity for the poor soul who comes to that school again looking for trouble.
m614	MAGNETO	And what do you do when you wake up to that?
m614	XAVIER	It does indeed Max.
m614	MAGNETO	Doesn't it ever wake you in the middle of the night?  The feeling that some day some day very soon they will pass that foolish law - or one just like it - and they will come for you and your children?  Take you all away?
m614	XAVIER	I know.
m614	MAGNETO	I wouldn't really have let you die you know.  I just needed...
m614	XAVIER	WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO DO?
m614	MAGNETO	This checkmate goes to you.  I didn't want to hurt anyone.  But you leave me no choice.
m614	XAVIER	What do you mean to do?
m614	MAGNETO	I'm going to change the world with or without you as a witness Charles.  And this one gets a front row seat.
m614	XAVIER	The way what is going to be?
m614	MAGNETO	If I could make you understand.  If you could just be made to see it the way I do.  The way it's going to be.
m614	MAGNETO	Let's just say that I am out to make some radical changes.  Now come on Charles.  For old times sake for your sake...  Leave him to me.
m614	XAVIER	You definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me Max. What is it like these days?
m614	MAGNETO	Still trying to make the world safe for our kind.  Still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves -- definitively.
m614	XAVIER	Is that so?
m614	XAVIER	What do you want with him?
m614	MAGNETO	The two in Alaska.  Just how do you people manage to be in the right place at the right time?  Still tinkering with Cerebro?
m614	XAVIER	Not at the cost of lives Max.
m614	MAGNETO	I am trying to save our kind Charles. You should do the same.
m614	XAVIER	And I'll never understand terrorists.
m614	MAGNETO	I'll never understand your regard for them Charles.
